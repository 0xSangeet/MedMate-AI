Chronic bronchitis
A chronic inflammation of the bronchial mucosa due to irritation (tobacco, pollution), allergy (asthma) or infection
(repetitive acute bronchitis). It may develop into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Clinical features
Productive cough for 3 consecutive months per year for 2 successive years.
No dyspnoea at onset. Dyspnoea develops after several years, first on exertion, then becoming persistent.
On pulmonary auscultation: bronchial wheeze (always exclude tuberculosis).
A patient with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis presents with:
Onset or increase of dyspnoea.
Increased volume of sputum.
Purulent sputum.
Treatment
Antibiotic treatment is not useful in treating simple chronic bronchitis.
Antibiotic treatment may be useful, for patients in a poor general condition only, for acute exacerbations of chronic
bronchitis (see Acute bronchitis).
Discourage smoking and other irritating factors.
