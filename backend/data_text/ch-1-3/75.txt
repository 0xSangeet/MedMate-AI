Ampicillin is preferably administered in 4 divided doses. If the context does not permit it, the daily dose must be divided
in at least 3 doses.
The treatment is administered by parenteral route for at least 3 days then, if the clinical condition has improved c and
oral treatment can be tolerated, switch to amoxicillin PO: 30 mg/kg 3 times daily to complete 10 days of treatment.
If the child's condition deteriorates or does not improve after 48 hours of correct administration, add cloxacillin IV: 25
to 50 mg/kg every 6 hours. After clinical improvement and 3 days with no fever, switch to amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid (co-amoxiclav) PO to complete 10 to 14 days of treatment. Use formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1
exclusively. The dose is expressed in amoxicillin: 50 mg/kg 2 times daily.
