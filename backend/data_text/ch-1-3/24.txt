Anaemia
Last updated: January 2024
Anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) level below reference values [1] [2] , which vary depending on age, sex, and
pregnancy status (see Table 2).
Anaemia may be caused by:
Decreased production of red blood cells: iron deficiency, nutritional deficiencies (folic acid, vitamin B , vitamin A),
12
depressed bone marrow function, certain infections (HIV, visceral leishmaniasis), renal failure;
Loss of red blood cells: acute or chronic haemorrhage (gastrointestinal ulcer, ancylostomiasis, schistosomiasis,
etc.);
Increased destruction of red blood cells (haemolysis): parasitic (malaria), bacterial and viral (HIV) infections;
haemoglobinopathies (sickle cell disease, thalassaemia); intolerance to certain drugs (primaquine, dapsone, co-
trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, etc.) in patients with G6PD deficiency.
The causes of anaemia are often interlinked.
Clinical features
Common signs: pallor of the conjunctivae, mucous membranes, palms of hands and soles of feet; fatigue,
dizziness, dyspnoea, tachycardia, heart murmur.
Signs of decompensation: cold extremities, altered mental status, oedema in the lower limbs, respiratory distress,
elevated jugular venous pressure, cardiac/coronary failure, shock.
Significant signs: cheilosis and glossitis (nutritional deficiency), jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, dark coloured urine
(haemolysis), bleeding (maelena, haematuria, etc.), signs of malaria (Chapter 6), etc.
Laboratory
Hb levels
Rapid diagnostic test or thick and thin blood films in areas where malaria is endemic.
Urinary dipstick: check for haemoglobinuria or haematuria.
If sickle cell disease is suspected (to be done before blood transfusion): rapid diagnostic test (Sickle SCANÂ®) or, if
not available, Emmel test.
Full blood count (FBC) if available to guide diagnosis.
