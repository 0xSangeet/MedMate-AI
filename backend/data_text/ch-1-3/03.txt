Check whether a BZD has been administered before arrival at the hospital and the number of doses. If one dose was
administered, give a second dose. If 2 doses were administered, start Step 2 - Second-line ASM treatment.
If no pre-hospital dose of BZD was administered:
If IV or IO access: diazepam (5 mg/ml solution) by slow IV injection (over 3 to 5 minutes). For doses to be
administered, see Table 1.
If no IV or IO access: midazolam (5 mg/ml solution) by buccal or intranasal route or midazolam (1 mg/ml solution)
by IM route or diazepam (5 mg/ml solution) by rectal route. For doses to be administered, see Table 1.
If seizures do not stop 5 minutes after the first dose of BZD, readminister the same dose.
If seizures do not stop after the second dose of BZD, start Step 2 - Second-line ASM treatment.
If seizures recur:
6 hours or more after seizures stop, restart treatment from Step 1 - First-line ASM treatment as for a new
seizure,
Less than 6 hours after seizures stop, continue treatment at the last point, e.g.:
if seizures recur < 6 hours after a first dose of BZD, readminister the same dose,
if seizures recur < 6 hours after 2 doses of BZD, start Step 2 - Second-line ASM treatment.
If seizures stop after 1 or 2 doses of BZD and do not recur, see Postictal management and evaluate the need for
maintenance ASM treatment.

(a) Midazolam buccal route: lay the patient on their side. Withdraw the required dose using a 1 ml or 2 ml syringe. Remove the
needle. Insert the tip of the syringe into the space between the gum and cheek. Administer the dose by slowly pushing the
syringe plunger.
(b) Midazolam intranasal route: lay the patient on their back or side. Withdraw the required dose using a 1 ml or 2 ml syringe
(add an additional 0.1 ml to the calculated dose to account for the remaining liquid in the atomising device). Remove the
needle. Attach the intranasal atomisation device to the syringe. Briskly push the syringe plunger to spray the dose into the
nostril. The dose can be split in both nostrils to reduce irritation.
(c) Diazepam rectal route: lay the patient on their side. For volumes up to 1 ml, use a 1 ml syringe. Withdraw the required dose.
Remove the needle. Insert the syringe into the rectum for a length of 1 to 3 cm (depending on age) to administer the dose.
For volumes greater than 1 ml, use a 2 ml syringe and attach to the tip of the syringe a nasogastric tube n°8 cut to a length
of 2 to 3 cm to administer the dose. After administration, hold the buttocks together for at least one minute.
