Eradication of Helicobacter pylori
Most peptic ulcers are caused by Helicobacter pylori infection. If a diagnosis of ulcer is probable, treatment to
eradicate H. pylori should be considered if the patient has frequent attacks requiring repeated and/or prolonged
treatments with antiulcer drugs over 8 weeks or in cases of complicated ulcers (perforation or gastrointestinal
bleeding). Infection should be confirmed with a test where possible.
H. pylori resistance to antibiotics varies globally, follow national recommendations where available. If not, for
information, administer a triple therapy for 7 days:
omeprazole PO 20 mg 2 times daily + clarithromycin PO 500 mg 2 times daily + amoxicillin PO 1 g 2 times daily a .
In immunocompromised patients, consider mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection or other nontuberculous
mycobacterium (NTM) infection prior to starting a clarithromycin-containing triple therapy.
If symptoms continue despite treatment, consider the differential diagnosis of gastric cancer. Refer for investigations
if possible.
Notes:
Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and NSAID (ibuprofen, diclofenac, etc.) are contra-indicated in patients suffering from
or with a history of ulcers.
Omeprazole is as effective PO as IV.
Footnotes
(a) In penicillin-allergic patients, amoxicillin PO can be substituted with metronidazole PO 500 mg 2 times daily.
