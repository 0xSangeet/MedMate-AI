salbutamol metered-dose inhaler (MDI) 100 micrograms/puff: 2 to 10 puffs every 20 minutes during the first
hour. In children, use a spacer a (use face mask in children under 3 years). Single puffs should be given one at a
time, let the child breathe 4 to 5 times from the spacer before repeating the procedure. A spacer can also be
used in adults to increase effectiveness.
prednisolone PO: one dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg (max. 50 mg) for children over 5 years and adults
oxygen if SpO < 94% b .

If the attack is completely resolved:
Observe the patient for 1 hour (4 hours if they live far from the health centre) then give outpatient
treatment: salbutamol MDI for 24 to 48 hours (2 to 4 puffs every 4 to 6 hours depending on clinical evolution)
and prednisolone PO (same dose as above once daily) to complete 5 days of treatment.
Reassess after 1 to 2 days: address any identified risk factor, reassess need for salbutamol and long-term
treatment. If the patient is already receiving long-term treatment, reevaluate the severity of the asthma (see
Chronic asthma), review compliance and correct use of medications and adjust treatment if necessary.
If the attack is only partially resolved, continue with salbutamol MDI (2 to 10 puffs every 1 to 4 hours) until
symptoms subside. For children up to 5 years, administer one dose of prednisolone PO as above if symptoms
recur within 3 to 4 hours. When the attack is completely resolved, proceed as above.
If symptoms worsen or do not improve, treat as severe attack.
Severe attack
Hospitalise c ; place the patient in a 1/2 sitting position.
Administer:
oxygen to maintain SpO between 94 and 98% b .
2
salbutamol + ipratropium nebuliser solutions using a nebuliser (continue oxygen via nasal cannula during
nebulisation):
Children < 5 years salbutamol 2.5 mg (1.25 ml) + ipratropium 0.25 mg (1 ml) every 20 minutes for the
first hour
Children 5 to 11 years salbutamol 2.5 to 5 mg (1.25 to 2.5 ml) + ipratropium 0.5 mg (2 ml) every 20
minutes for the first hour
Children 12 years and over salbutamol 5 mg (2.5 ml) + ipratropium 0.5 mg (2 ml) every 20 minutes for the first
and adults hour
The two solutions should be mixed in the drug reservoir of the nebuliser. Assess symptoms at the end of each
nebulisation.
If there is no nebuliser, use salbutamol MDI (same dose as for mild to moderate attack) and ipratropium MDI
20 micrograms/puff, 4 to 8 puffs every 20 minutes for the first hour.
prednisolone PO: one dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg (max. 50 mg)
If prednisolone is not available, or if the patient cannot take oral treatment, administer:
Children: dexamethasone PO/IV/IM, one dose of 0.15 to 0.6 mg/kg (max. 16 mg)
Adults: hydrocortisone IV, 4 mg/kg (max. 100 mg) every 6 hours for 24 hours
If symptoms do not improve after one hour:
transfer to intensive care unit
insert an IV line
oxygen to maintain SpO between 94 and 98% b
2
continue salbutamol (solution for nebuliser) without ipratropium, and corticosteroids as above.
administer one dose of magnesium sulfate by IV infusion in 0.9% sodium chloride over 20 minutes, monitoring
blood pressure:
