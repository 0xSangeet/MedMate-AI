Stomatitis from scurvy (vitamin C deficiency)
Other lesions resulting from a nutritional deficiency
Stomatitis is an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth caused by a fungal, viral or bacterial infection, a
vitamin deficiency, an injury, etc.
Prolonged or painful stomatitis may contribute to dehydration or may cause loss of appetite with denutrition,
particularly in children.
In infants, examine routinely the mouth in the event of breast refusal or difficulties in sucking.
In all cases:
Maintain adequate hydration and feeding; offer foods that will not irritate the mucosa (soft, non-acidic). Use a
nasogastric tube for a few days if pain is preventing the patient from eating.
Keep the mouth clean to prevent complications and recurrence.
