Acute diarrhoea
Acute diarrhoea is defined as at least 3 liquid stools per day for less than 2 weeks.
There are 2 clinical types of acute diarrhoea:
Diarrhoea without blood, caused by viruses in 60% of cases (rotavirus, enterovirus), bacteria (Vibrio cholerae,
enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, non Typhi Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica) or parasites (giardiasis).
Diseases, such as malaria, acute otitis media, respiratory tract infections, etc. can be accompanied by this type
of diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea with blood, caused by bacteria (Shigella in 50% of cases, Campylobacter jejuni, enteroinvasive or
enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Salmonella) or parasites (intestinal amoebiasis).
Infectious diarrhoeas are transmitted by direct (dirty hands) or indirect (ingestion of contaminated water or food)
contact.
The high mortality rate from diarrhoeal diseases, even benign, is due to acute dehydration and malnutrition. This can
be prevented by adequate rehydration and nutrition.
Clinical features
First assess for signs of dehydration (see Dehydration, Chapter 1).
Then look for other signs:
profuse watery diarrhoea (cholera, enterotoxigenic E. coli),
repeated vomiting (cholera),
fever (salmonellosis, viral diarrhoea),
presence of red blood in stools: see also Shigellosis and Amoebiasis (Chapter 3).
In a patient over 5 years with severe and rapid onset of dehydration, suspect cholera.
Treatment
General principles:
Prevent or treat dehydration: rehydration consists of prompt replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses as
required, until the diarrhoea stops.
Administer zinc sulfate to children under 5 years.
Prevent malnutrition.
Do not systematically administer antimicrobials: only certain diarrhoeas require antibiotics (see Antimicrobial
treatment).
Do not administer anti-diarrhoeal drugs or antiemetics.
Treat the underlying condition if any (malaria, otitis, respiratory infection, etc.).
Prevention and treatment of dehydration
See Dehydration, Chapter 1.
Adapted treatment protocols are recommended for children with malnutrition (see Severe acute malnutrition, Chapter
1).
Prevention of malnutrition
Continue unrestricted normal diet. In breastfed children, increase the frequency of feeds. Breast milk does not replace
ORS. ORS should be given between feeds.
