If the patientâ€™s stools are soft, a stimulant laxative (bisacodyl PO: children > 3 years: 5 to 10 mg once daily; adults:
10 to 15 mg once daily) is preferred.
Nausea and vomiting are common at the beginning of treatment.
Children:
ondansetron PO: 0.15 mg/kg (max. 4 mg per dose) up to 3 times daily
Do not use metoclopramide in children.
Adults:

daily with an interval of at least 6 hours between each dose

For chronic pain in late stage disease (cancer, AIDS etc.), morphine PO is the drug of choice. It may be necessary to
increase doses over time according to pain assessment. Do not hesitate to give sufficient and effective doses.
Morphine, tramadol and codeine have similar modes of action and should not be combined.
Buprenorphine, nalbuphine and pentazocine must not be combined with morphine, pethidine, tramadol or codeine
because they have competitive action.
