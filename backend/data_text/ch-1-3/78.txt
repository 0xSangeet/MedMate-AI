If the clinical condition deteriorates or does not improve after 48 hours of correct administration, administer
ceftriaxone as above + cloxacillin IV infusion:
Children: 25 to 50 mg/kg every 6 hours
Adults: 2 g every 6 hours
After clinical improvement and 3 days with no fever, switch to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) PO to
complete 10 to 14 days of treatment. Use formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1 exclusively. The dose is expressed in
amoxicillin:
Children < 40 kg: 50 mg/kg 2 times daily
Children ≥ 40 kg and adults:
Ratio 8:1: 3000 mg daily (2 tablets of 500/62.5 mg 3 times daily)
Ratio 7:1: 2625 mg daily (1 tablet of 875/125 mg 3 times daily)
If the clinical condition does not improve after 48 hours with ceftriaxone + cloxacillin, consider tuberculosis. For the
diagnosis, refer to the guide Tuberculosis, MSF.
If tuberculosis is unlikely, continue with ceftriaxone + cloxacillin and add azithromycin (see Atypical pneumonia).
Adjuvant therapy
Fever: paracetamol PO (Chapter 1).
Clear the airway (nasal irrigation with 0.9% sodium chloride if needed).
Oxygen at the flow rate required to maintain SpO ≥ 90% or, if pulse oxymeter is not available, minimum 1
2
litre/minute.
Maintain adequate hydration and nutrition.
Pneumonia without signs of severity (outpatient treatment)
amoxicillin PO
Children: 30 mg/kg 3 times daily (max. 3 g daily) for 5 days
Adults: 1 g 3 times daily for 5 days
Follow-up in 48 to 72 hours or sooner if the patient's condition deteriorates:
If the condition is improving b : continue with the same antibiotic to complete treatment.
If there is no improvement after 3 days of correct administration: add azithromycin (see Atypical pneumonia).
If the condition is deteriorating: hospitalise and treat as severe pneumonia.
