Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is used as second-line treatment, in the case of treatment failure. Treatment failure is
defined as persistence of fever and/or ear pain after 48 hours of antibiotic treatment.
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) PO for 5 days
Use formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1. The dose is expressed in amoxicillin:
Children < 40 kg: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily
Children â‰¥ 40 kg and adult:
Ratio 8:1: 2000 mg daily (2 tablets of 500/62.5 mg 2 times daily)
Ratio 7:1: 1750 mg daily (1 tablet of 875/125 mg 2 times daily)
Persistence of a ear drainage alone, without fever and pain, in a child who has otherwise improved (reduction in
systemic symptoms and local inflammation) does not warrant a change in antibiotic therapy. Clean ear canal by
gentle dry mopping until no more drainage is obtained.
Macrolides should be reserved for very rare penicillin-allergic patients, as treatment failure (resistance to
macrolides) is frequent.
azithromycin PO
Children over 6 months: 10 mg/kg once daily for 3 days
