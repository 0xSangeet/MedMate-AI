Nociceptive pain
The WHO classifies analgesics used for this type of pain on a three-step ladder:
Step 1: non-opioid analgesics such as paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Step 2: weak opioid analgesics such as codeine and tramadol. Their combination with one or two Step 1 analgesics
is recommended.
Step 3: strong opioid analgesics, first and foremost morphine. Their combination with one or two Step 1 analgesics
is recommended.
The treatment of pain is based on a few fundamental concepts:
Pain can only be treated correctly if it is correctly evaluated. The only person who can evaluate the intensity of pain
is the patient himself. The use of pain assessment scales is invaluable.
The pain evaluation observations should be recorded in the patient chart in the same fashion as other vital signs.
Treatment of pain should be as prompt as possible.
It is recommended to administer analgesics in advance when appropriate (e.g. before painful care procedures).
Analgesics should be prescribed and administered at fixed time intervals (not on demand).
Oral forms should be used whenever possible.
The combination of different analgesic drugs (multimodal analgesia) is advantageous.
Start with an analgesic from the level presumed most effective: e.g., in the event of a fractured femur, start with a
Step 3 analgesic.
The treatment and dose chosen are guided by the assessment of pain intensity, but also by the patientâ€™s response
which may vary significantly from one person to another.
Treatment of acute pain
Mild pain Paracetamol + /- NSAID
Moderate pain Paracetamol + /- NSAID + tramadol or codeine
Severe pain Paracetamol + /- NSAID + morphine
