Diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) b derived from horse serum:
Administer DAT as soon as possible after disease onset. Do not wait for bacteriological confirmation [1] ; administer
DAT under close monitoring in a hospital setting, according to the Besredka method to assess possibility of allergy.
Any delay can diminish efficacy.
There is a risk of anaphylactic reaction, especially in patients with asthma. Close monitoring of the patient is
essential, with immediate availability of equipment for manual ventilation (Ambu bag, face mask) and
intubation, Ringer lactate and epinephrine (see Shock, Chapter 1).
Besredka method: inject 0.1 ml SC and wait 15 minutes. If there is no allergic reaction (no erythema at the injection
site or a flat erythema of less than 0.5 cm in diameter), inject a further 0.25 ml SC. If there is no reaction after 15
minutes, inject the rest of the product IM or IV depending on the volume to be administered.
Doses are given as a function of the severity of illness, and the delay in treatment:
Clinical signs Dose in units Administration route
Laryngitis or pharyngitis
20 to 40 000
or duration < 48 hours
IM or IV infusion in 250 ml of 0.9% sodium
Rhinopharyngitis 40 to 60 000
chloride in 2 to 4 hours for doses of more
than 20 000 units.
Severe disease (respiratory distress,
shock), cervical oedema or duration â‰¥ 48 80 to 100 000
hours
Antibiotic treatment (as soon as possible without waiting for bacteriological confirmation ) for 14 days or according
to length of treatment recommended by the national protocol:
if the patient can swallow:
azithromycin PO (first-line)
Children: 10 to 12 mg/kg once daily (max. 500 mg daily)
Adults: 500 mg once daily
or
erythromycin PO
Children under 40 kg: 10 to 15 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) 4 times daily
Children 40 kg and over and adults: 500 mg 4 times daily
or
phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) PO
Children under 40 kg: 10 to 15 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) 4 times daily
Children 40 kg and over and adults: 500 mg 4 times daily
If the patient cannot swallow, start with one of the treatments below and change as soon as possible to oral
route with one of the oral treatments above to complete 14 days of treatment:
procaine benzylpenicillin IM
Children under 25 kg: 50 000 IU/kg (= 50 mg/kg) once daily (max. 1.2 MIU = 1.2 g daily)
Children 25 kg and over and adults: 1.2 MIU (= 1.2 g) once daily
Never administer procaine benzylpenicillin by IV injection or infusion.
In penicillin-allergic patients, use erythromycin IV c .
Intubation/tracheotomy if necessary (airway obstruction, respiratory failure, etc.).
If the event of shock, see Shock, Chapter 1, for complementary treatment.
Update every patient's vaccination status before hospital discharge (or during first visit, if receiving home-based
care). If the patient has been administered DAT and can receive adequate home-based follow up after hospital
discharge, wait 3 weeks after administration of DAT before vaccination.
