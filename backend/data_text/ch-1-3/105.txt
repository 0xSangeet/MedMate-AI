Oral and oropharyngeal candidiasis
Infection due to Candida albicans, common in infants, immunocompromised or diabetic patients. Other risk factors
include treatment with oral antibiotics or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids.
Clinical features
White patches on the tongue, inside the cheeks, that may spread to the pharynx.
In patients with frequent recurrences or extensive forms invading the esophagus (swallowing difficulty and pain),
consider HIV infection.
Treatment
nystatin oral suspension for 7 days
Children and adults: 400 000 IU daily, i.e. 1 ml of the oral suspension (100 000 IU) 4 times daily
or
miconazole oral gel for 7 days
Children 6 months to 2 years: 1.25 ml 4 times daily
Children over 2 years and adults: 2.5 ml 4 times daily
Apply the oral suspension of nystatin or the oral gel of miconazole between meals; keep in the mouth for 2 to 3
minutes, then swallow. In young children, apply to the tongue and inside of each cheek.
Show the mother how to treat since, in most cases, candidiasis will be treated at home.
In immunocompromised patients: see HIV infection and AIDS, Chapter 8.
