(a) Immediate transfusion is not required in children 2 months to 12 years with Hb ≥ 4 g/dl and < 6 g/dl and no sign of
decompensation or ongoing blood loss, provided that:
• they are closely monitored (including Hb measurements at 8, 24 and 48 hours), and
• transfusion preparation (blood grouping, etc.) is carried out without delay in case the child needs to be transfused later
on.
Footnotes
(a) A coformulated tablet of ferrous salts/folic acid contains 185 mg of ferrous fumarate or sulfate (equivalent to 60 mg of
elemental iron) and 400 micrograms of folic acid.
A 200 mg tablet of ferrous fumarate or sulfate contains 65 mg of elemental iron.
A 140 mg/5 ml syrup of ferrous fumarate contains 45 mg/5 ml of elemental iron.
(b) Before transfusing: determine the recipient’s and potential donors’ blood groups/rhesus and carry out screening tests on
the donor’s blood for HIV-1 and 2, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and, in endemic areas, malaria and Chagas disease.
(c) Axillary temperature should be taken at the time of ordering blood and immediately prior to transfusion.
