If there is significant pleural effusion: pleural tap with drainage (for pyopneumothorax; insert 2 drains, one anterior
and one posterior) or without drainage (for suppurative pleurisy, make repetitive taps with an IV catheter).
Clinical evolution
There is a serious risk of decompensation from pneumothorax or suppurative pleurisy or pyopneumothorax.
On a paediatric ward, adequate equipment for urgent pleural drainage should always be available.
Footnotes
(a) The solvent of ceftriaxone for IM injection contains lidocaine. Ceftriaxone reconstituted using this solvent must never be
administered by IV route. For IV administration, water for injection must always be used.
(b) Cloxacillin powder for injection should be reconstituted in 4 ml of water for injection. Then dilute each dose of cloxacillin in
5 ml/kg of 0.9% sodium chloride or 5 % glucose in children less than 20 kg and in a bag of 100 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride or
5% glucose in children 20 kg and over and in adults.
(c) Improvement criteria include: fever reduction, diminished respiratory distress, improved SpO2, improved appetite and/or
activity.
