Pneumonia in children over 5 years and adults
The most common causes are viruses, pneumococcus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
Clinical features
Cough, with or without purulent sputum, fever, thoracic pain, tachypnoea
On pulmonary auscultation: decreased vesicular breath sounds, dullness, localised foci of crepitations, sometimes
bronchial wheeze.
Sudden onset with high fever (higher than 39 Â°C), thoracic pain and oral herpes are suggestive of pneumococcal
infection. Symptoms may be confusing, particularly in children with abdominal pain, meningeal syndrome, etc.
Signs of severity (severe pneumonia) include:
Cyanosis (lips, oral mucosa, fingernails)
Nasal flaring
Intercostal or subclavial indrawing
RR > 30 breaths/minute
Heart rate > 125 beats/minute
Altered level of consciousness (drowsiness, confusion)
Patients at risk include the older patients, patients with heart failure, sickle cell disease or severe chronic bronchitis;
immunocompromised patients (severe malnutrition, HIV infection with CD4 < 200).
Treatment
Severe pneumonia (inpatient treatment)
ceftriaxone IM or slow IV a (3 minutes)
Children: 50 mg/kg once daily
Adults: 1 g once daily
The treatment is given by parenteral route for at least 3 days then, if the clinical condition has improved b and oral
treatment can be tolerated, switch to amoxicillin PO to complete 7 to 10 days of treatment:
Children: 30 mg/kg 3 times daily (max. 3 g daily)
Adults: 1 g 3 times daily
or
ampicillin slow IV (3 minutes) or IM
Children: 50 mg/kg every 6 hours
Adults: 1 g every 6 to 8 hours
Ampicillin is preferably administered in 4 divided doses. If the context does not permit it, the daily dose must be divided
in at least 3 doses.
The treatment is given by parenteral route for at least 3 days then, if the clinical condition has improved b and oral
treatment can be tolerated, switch to the oral route with amoxicillin PO as above, to complete 7 to 10 days of
treatment.
