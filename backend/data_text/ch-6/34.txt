In the case of concomitant lymphatic filariasis: administer ivermectin first then start treatment for lymphatic
filariasis with doxycycline PO (see Lymphatic filariasis) one week later.
Nodulectomy (surgical removal of onchocercomas)
Nodules are benign, often deep, and their ablation does not treat onchocerciasis. Thus, nodulectomy is reserved for
cranial nodules (their proximity to the eye is a risk factor for visual compromise) or nodules which are cosmetically
unacceptable. In other cases, refrain from nodulectomy. Nodulectomy is performed under local anaesthesia, in an
appropriately equipped facility.
Footnotes
(a) Differential diagnosis is sarcoptic scabies (Scabies, Chapter 4).
(b) Elimination of Wolbachia reduces the longevity and fertility of the macrofilariae, and thus the production of new microfilariae
within the organism.
(c) Ivermectin kills microfilariae and disrupts production of microfilariae by adult worms. However the treatment must be
administered at regular intervals since it does not kill adult worms.
