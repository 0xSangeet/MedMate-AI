Ascariasis is usually benign, but massive
infestation may cause intestinal obstruction
(abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation),
especially in children < 5 years. Worms may
accidentally migrate to gall bladder, liver or
peritoneum, causing jaundice, liver abscess, or
peritonitis.
Ascaris eggs may be detected through
parasitological examination of stools.
