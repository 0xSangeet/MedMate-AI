Schistosomiases
Schistosomiases are acute or chronic visceral parasitic diseases due to 5 species of trematodes (schistosomes). The
three main species infecting humans are Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma
japonicum. Schistosoma mekongi and Schistosoma intercalatum have a more limited distribution.
Humans are infected while wading/bathing in fresh water infested with schistosome larvae. Symptoms occurring during
the phases of parasite invasion (transient localized itching as larvae penetrate the skin) and migration (allergic
manifestations and gastrointestinal symptoms during migration of schistosomules) are frequently overlooked. In
general, schistosomiasis is suspected when symptoms of established infection become evident. Each species gives
rise to a specific clinical form: genito-urinary schistosomiasis due to S. haematobium, intestinal schistosomiasis due S.
mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi and S. intercalatum.
The severity of the disease depends on the parasite load. Heavily infected patients are prone to visceral lesions with
potentially irreversible sequelae. Children aged 5 to 15 years are particularly at risk: prevalence and parasite load are
highest in this age group.
An antiparasitic treatment should be administered to reduce the risk of severe lesions, even if there is a likelihood of re-
infection.
