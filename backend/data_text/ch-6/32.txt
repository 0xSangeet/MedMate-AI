Filariasis
Onchocerciasis (river blindness)
Loiasis.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF)
Filariases are helminthiases due to tissue-dwelling nematode worms (filariae). Human to human transmission takes
place through the bite of an insect vector.
The most important pathogens are outlined in the table below. Mixed infections are common in co-endemic regions.
Each filarial species is found in 2 principal developmental stages: macrofilariae (adult worms) and microfilariae (larval
offspring). The treatment depends on the pathogenic stage of the species considered and targets microfilariae for O.
volvulus and macrofilariae for the other species.
Location of Location of Pathogenic Presence
Species/Infections
macrofilariae microfilariae stage of Wolbachia
Onchocerca volvulus Subcutaneous
Skin and eye Microfilariae Yes
(onchocerciasis) nodules
Loa loa Subcutaneous
Blood Macrofilariae No
(loiasis) tissue
Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia
malayi and Brugia timori Lymph vessels Blood Macrofilariae Yes
(lymphatic filariasis)
Classical antifilarial agents include diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin and albendazole. Doxycycline is used solely in
the treatment of O. volvulus and lymphatic filarial worms, which harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium (Wolbachia)
sensitive to doxycycline.
