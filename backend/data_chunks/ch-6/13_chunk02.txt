or history of severe mental disorders or seizures. Adverse effects (gastrointestinal disturbances, agitation, sleeping disorders, seizure) are frequent and reversible and should not necessarily result in discontinuation of treatment.

Prevention Individual protection against bite from triatomine bugs: use of long-lasting insecticidal net. In healthcare settings: standard precautions to avoid contamination with soiled materials or potentially infected body fluids. Blood transfusions: advise patients with Chagas disease not to donate blood. In endemic areas, screen donor blood for Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies.

If the result is positive, a second serologic test should then be performed to confirm the diagnosis before starting treatment. References Page 19 2/ 409
