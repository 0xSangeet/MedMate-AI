2) L. loa microfilaraemia is between 2,000 and 8,000 mf/ml Reduce microfilaraemia with ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg single dose); repeat the treatment every month if necessary; administer DEC when the microfilaraemia is < 2000 mf/ml. 3) L. loa microfilaraemia is between 8,000 and 30,000 mf/ml Treatment with ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg single dose) may cause marked functional impairment for several days. Close supervision and support from family member(s) are necessary b . Prescribe paracetamol as well for 7 days. 4) L. loa microfilaraemia is > 30,000 mf/ml If the loiasis is well tolerated, it is preferable to refrain from treatment: the disease is benign and treatment with ivermectin may cause very severe adverse reactions (encephalopathy), albeit rarely. If loiasis has a significant clinical impact and/or the patient presents with symptomatic onchocerciasis requiring treatment, ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg single dose) is administered for 5 days under supervision in hospital c . An attempt to first reduce L. loa microfilaraemia using albendazole (200 mg 2 times daily for 3 weeks) is an option. When L. loa microfilaraemia is < 30 000 mf/ml, treat with ivermectin under close supervision and support, then DEC when the microfilaraemia is < 2000 mf/ml. Extraction of macrofilariae Subcutaneous migration of a microfilaria usually results from treatment with DEC; the worm will die beneath the skin and extracting it serves no purpose. Removal of an adult worm from the conjunctiva: see Loasis, Chapter 5. Footnotes (a) For differential diagnosis, see cutaneous larva migrans. (b) Patients may present with various pain syndromes, be unable to move without help or unable to move at all. Monitoring is necessary to determine whether the patient can manage activities of daily living, and provide assistance if necessary. If the patient remains bedridden for several days, ensure pressure sores do not develop (mobilisation, repositioning). (c) A severe
