disorders (amenorrhoea, impotence). In the absence of treatment: cachexia, lethargy, coma and death. Rhodesiense HAT The first stage is the same as above, but the incubation period is shorter (< 3 weeks), the disease evolves more rapidly and symptoms are more severe. Patients often die of myocarditis in 3 to 6 months without having developed signs of the meningo-encephalitic stage. In practice, gambiense and rhodesiense HAT can be difficult to differentiate: e.g., there exist cases of acute gambiense infection and others of chronic rhodesiense infection. Laboratory Diagnosis involves 3 steps for gambiense HAT (screening test, diagnostic confirmation and stage determination) and 2 steps for rhodesiense HAT (diagnostic confirmation and stage determination). The recommended screening test for T.b. gambiense infection is the CATT (Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis). It detects the presence of specific antibodies in the patient’s blood or serum. Diagnostic confirmation: presence of trypanosomes in lymph node aspirates or in blood using concentration techniques: capillary tube centrifugation technique (Woo test), quantitative buffy coat (QBC), mini-anion exchange centrifugation technique (mAEC). Stage determination: detection of trypanosomes (after centrifugation) and white cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid (lumbar puncture): Haemolymphatic stage: no trypanosomes AND ≤ 5 white cells/mm3 Page 18 8/ 409
