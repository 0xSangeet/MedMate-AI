epidemic context In the Sahelian region (but not exclusively, e.g. Rwanda, Angola, Brazil), during the dry season, epidemics of meningococcal meningitis (Neisseria meningitidis A or C or W135) affect children from 6 months of age, adolescents and adults. In these regions, whether during epidemics or not, all the above pathogens can be found, especially in young children. Clinical features The clinical presentation depends on the patient's age. Children over 1 year and adults Fever, severe headache, photophobia, neck stiffness Brudzinski's sign (neck flexion in a supine patient results in involuntary flexion of the knees) and Kernig's sign (attempts to extend the knee from the flexed-thigh position are met with strong passive resistance). Petechial or ecchymotic purpura (usually in meningococcal infections) In severe forms: coma, seizures, focal signs, purpura fulminans Children under 1 year The classic signs of meningitis are usually absent. The child is irritable, appears sick with fever or hypothermia, poor feeding or vomiting. Other features include: seizures, apnoea, altered consciousness, bulging fontanelle (when not crying); occasionally, neck stiffness and purpuric rash. Page 21 9/ 409
