is contra-indicated (risk of severe ocular lesions). Doxycycline PO (200 mg once daily for 4 weeks; if possible 6 weeks) kills a significant percentage of adult worms and progressively reduces the number of O. volvulus microfilariae b . It is contraindicated in children < 8 years and pregnant or breast-feeding women. Ivermectin PO is the drug of choice: 150 micrograms/kg single dose; a 2nd dose should be administered after 3 months if clinical signs persist. Repeat the treatment every 6 or 12 months to maintain the parasite load below the threshold at which clinical signs appear c . Ivermectin is not recommended in children < 5 years or < 15 kg and pregnant women. In case of co-infection with Loa loa or in regions where loiasis is co-endemic, ivermectin should be administered with caution (risk of severe adverse reactions in patients with high L. loa microfilarial load): If it is possible to test for Loa loa (thick blood film): Confirm and quantify the microfilaraemia. Administer the appropriate treatment according to the microfilarial load (see Loiasis). If it is not possible to perform a thick film examination, take a history from the patient: If the patient has received a previous treatment with ivermectin without developing serious adverse reactions (see Loiasis), administer the treatment. If the patient has never received ivermectin nor developed signs of loiasis (migration of an adult worm under the conjunctiva, or « Calabar » swellings), administer the treatment. If the patient already has developed signs of loiaisis and if onchocerciasis has a significant clinical impact, administer ivermectin under close supervision (see Loiasis) or use an alternative (doxycycline, as above).
