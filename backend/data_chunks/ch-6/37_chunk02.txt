to accumulation within the tunica vaginalis (hydrocoele, lymphocoele, chylocoele); chronic epididymo-orchitis. Chyluria: milky or rice-water urine (disruption of a lymphatic vessel in the urinary tract). In patients parasitized by Brugia spp, genital lesions and chyluria are rare: lymphoedema is usually confined to below the knee. Laboratory Detection of microfilariae in the peripheral blood (thick film) a ; blood specimens should be collected between 9 pm and 3 am. In regions where loiasis and/or onchocerciasis are co-endemic, check for co-infection if the LF diagnosis is positive. Treatment Antiparasitic treatment Treatment is not administered during an acute attack. Doxycycline PO, when administered as a prolonged treatment, eliminates the majority of macrofilariae and reduces lymphoedema: 200 mg once daily for 4 weeks minimum. It is contraindicated in children < 8 years and pregnant or breast-feeding women. Diethylcarbamazine PO single dose (400 mg in adults; 3 mg/kg in children) may be an alternative but eliminates a variable proportion of adult worms (up to 40%) and does not relieve symptoms; a prolonged treatment is no more effective than single dose therapy. In addition, DEC is contra-indicated in patients with onchocerciasis or Loa loa microfilarial load > 2000 mf/ml and in pregnant and breast-feeding women. Page 21 6/ 409
