Giardiasis tinidazole PO single dose Children: 50 mg/kg (max. 2 g) Adults: 2 g or metronidazole PO for 3 days Children: 30 mg/kg once daily Adults: 2 g once daily Cryptosporidiosis In immunocompetent patients, no aetiological treatment; spontaneous resolution in 1 to 2 weeks. Cyclosporiasis co-trimoxazole PO for 7 days Children: 25 mg SMX + 5 mg TMP/kg 2 times daily Adults: 800 mg SMX + 160 mg TMP 2 times daily In immunocompetent patients, symptoms usually resolve spontaneous in 1 to 3 weeks. Treatment is given in case of severe or prolonged symptoms. Isoporiasis co-trimoxazole PO for 7 to 10 days Adults: 800 mg SMX + 160 mg TMP 2 times daily In immunocompetent patients, symptoms usually resolve spontaneous in 2 to 3 weeks. Treatment is given in case of severe or prolonged symptoms. If reliable stool examination cannot be carried out: parasitic diarrhoeas cannot be differentiated on clinical grounds, nor is it possible to distinguish these from non- parasitic diarrhoeas. An empirical treatment (using tinidazole or metronidazole and co-trimoxazole as above, together or in succession) may be tried in the case of prolonged diarrhoea or steatorrhoea. In patients with HIV infection, see empirical treatment (HIV infections and AIDS, Chapter 8). In patients with advanced HIV disease, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis and isosporiasis are opportunistic infections; the most effective intervention is the treatment of the underlying HIV infection with antiretrovirals. Patients remain at high risk for dehydration/death until immunity is restored. Page 19 8/ 409
