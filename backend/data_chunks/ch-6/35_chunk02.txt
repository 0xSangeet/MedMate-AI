is contra-indicated in: Patients with microfilaraemia > 2000 mf/ml (risk of severe encephalopathy, with poor prognosis). Patients co-infected with O. volvulus (risk of severe eye lesions). Pregnant women, infants, and patients in poor general condition. Ivermectin (and possibly albendazole) is used to reduce microfilaraemia before administration of DEC; however, ivermectin administration may trigger encephalopathy in patients with very high Loa loa microfilaraemia (> 30 000 mf/ml). Doxycycline is not indicated since Loa loa does not harbour Wolbachia. Management: 1) L. loa microfilaraemia is < 1,000-2,000 mf/ml A 28-day treatment of DEC may be started using a small dose: 6 mg on D1, i.e. 1/8 of a 50 mg tablet 2 times daily. Double the dose every day up to 200 mg 2 times daily in adults (1.5 mg/kg 2 times daily in children). If microfilaraemia or symptoms persist, a second treatment is given 4 weeks later. If DEC is contra-indicated due to possible or confirmed co-infection with O. volvulus, ivermectin (150 microgams/kg single dose) treats onchocerciasis, and reduces pruritus and frequency of Calabar swellings. The treatment may be repeated every month or every 3 months. Page 21 4/ 409
