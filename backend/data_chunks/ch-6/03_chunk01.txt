Microscopy Thin and thick blood films enable parasite detection, species identification, quantification and monitoring of parasitaemia. Blood films may be negative due to sequestration of the parasitized erythrocytes in peripheral capillaries in severe malaria, as well as in placental vessels in pregnant women. Note: even with positive diagnostic results, rule out other causes of fever. Additional examinations Haemoglobin (Hb) level To be measured routinely in all patients with clinical anaemia, and in all patients with severe malaria. Blood glucose level To be measured routinely to detect hypoglycaemia in patients with severe malaria and those with malnutrition (see Hypoglycaemia, Chapter 1). Treatment of malaria due to P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, P. knowlesi chloroquine (CQ) PO b Children and adults: Day 1: 10 mg base/kg Day 2: 10 mg base/kg Day 3: 5 mg base/kg In general P. vivax remains sensitive to CQ but resistance is found in several countries. Where such resistance is high (>10%), or in countries which have de-registered CQ due to P. falciparum resistance, an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) c should be used instead [1] . For dosing information, see Treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Relapses can occur with P. vivax and P. ovale due to activation of dormant parasites in the liver. Primaquine PO for 14 days (0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg once daily in children â‰¥ 15 kg; 15 mg once daily in adults) can be given to eliminate these parasites, after the initial treatment with CQ or an ACT. However, this treatment is only recommended for patients living in areas where reinfection is unlikely, i.e. non-endemic, low transmission areas or in countries aiming for elimination of malaria. This treatment is contra-indicated in individuals with G6PD deficiency. If G6PD deficiency cannot be tested individually, the decision to prescribe primaquine must take into account the prevalence
