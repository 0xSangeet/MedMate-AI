with ivermectin without developing serious adverse reactions (see Loiasis), administer the treatment. If the patient has never received ivermectin nor developed signs of loiasis (migration of an adult worm under the conjunctiva, or « Calabar » swellings), administer the treatment. If the patient already has developed signs of loiaisis and if onchocerciasis has a significant clinical impact, administer ivermectin under close supervision (see Loiasis) or use an alternative (doxycycline, as above).
