Laboratory Lumbar puncture (LP): Macroscopic examination of CSF: antibiotic therapy should be initiated immediately if the LP yields a turbid CSF. Microscopic examination: Gram stain (but a negative examination does not exclude the diagnosis) and white blood cell count (WBC). In an epidemic context, once the meningococcal aetiology has been confirmed, there is no need for routine LP for new cases. WBC Other Pressure Aspect Protein (leucocytes/mm3) tests Pandy– Normal CSF Clear < 5 – < 40 mg/dl 100-20 000 mainly neutrophiles In neonates: Pandy+ Bacterial meningitis ++++ Cloudy, turbid > 20 100-500 Gram stain + In mg/dl immunocompromised, the WBC may be < 100 Normal to 10-700 Viral meningitis Clear Pandy– – + mainly lymphocytes Clear or < 500 TB meningitis +++ Pandy+ AFB yellowish mainly lymphocytes Cryptococcal < 800 ++++ Clear Pandy– India ink meningitis mainly lymphocytes Rapid test for detection of bacterial antigens. Note: in an endemic area, it is essential to test for severe malaria (rapid test or thin/thick films). Treatment in a non-epidemic context Antibiotic therapy For the choice of antibiotic therapy and dosages according to age, see table below. Page 22 0/ 409
