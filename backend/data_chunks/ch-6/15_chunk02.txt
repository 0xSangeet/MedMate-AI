weight loss are the main signs. Other signs include: anaemia, diarrhoea, epistaxis, lymphadenopathy, moderate hepatomegaly. Bacterial diarrhoea, pneumonia, and tuberculosis may develop due to immunosuppression. Post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis Macular, nodular or papular skin rash of unknown aetiology, particularly on the face, and typically occurring after apparent cure of visceral leishmaniasis. Laboratory Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis Parasitological diagnosis: identification of Giemsa-stained parasites in smears of tissue biopsy from the edge of the ulcer. No useful serological tests. Visceral leishmaniasis Parasitological diagnosis: identification of Giemsa-stained parasites in smears of splenic, bone marrow, or lymph node aspiration-biopsy. Splenic aspiration is the most sensitive technique but carries a theoretical risk of potentially fatal haemorrhage. Serological diagnosis: rK39 dipstick test and direct agglutination test (DAT) can be used for diagnosis of primary visceral leishmaniasis in clinically suspect cases. Diagnosis of relapse is only by parasitological confirmation. Page 19 4/ 409
