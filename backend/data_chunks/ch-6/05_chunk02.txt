doses), then, if the patient can tolerate the oral route, change to a complete 3-day course of an ACT. If not, continue parenteral treatment once daily until the patient can change to oral route (without exceeding 7 days of parenteral treatment). If artesunate is not unavailable, artemether may be an alternative: artemether IM into the anterior thigh (never administer by IV route) Children and adults: 3.2 mg/kg on admission (D1) then 1.6 mg/kg once daily Treat parenterally for at least 24 hours (2 doses), then, if the patient can tolerate the oral route, change to a complete 3-day course of an ACT. If not, continue parenteral treatment once daily until the patient can change to oral route (without exceeding 7 days of parenteral treatment). Note: if patient is still on parenteral treatment on Day 5, continue on the same treatment until Day 7. In this case it is not necessary to start an ACT. Quinine IV is still recommended in some national protocols. It may be used in treatment of malaria with shock if artesunate IV is not available. The dose is expressed in quinine salt: Loading dose: 20 mg/kg to be administered over 4 hours, then, keep the vein open with an infusion of 5% glucose over 4 hours; then Maintenance dose: 8 hours after the start of the loading dose, 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (alternate quinine over 4 hours and 5% glucose over 4 hours). For adults, administer each dose of quinine in 250 ml of glucose. For children under 20 kg, administer each dose of quinine in a volume of 10 ml/kg of glucose. Do not administer a loading dose to patients who have received oral quinine, or mefloquine within the previous 24 hours: start with maintenance dose. Treat parenterally for at least 24 hours, then,
