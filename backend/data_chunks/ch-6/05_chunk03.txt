open with an infusion of 5% glucose over 4 hours; then Maintenance dose: 8 hours after the start of the loading dose, 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (alternate quinine over 4 hours and 5% glucose over 4 hours). For adults, administer each dose of quinine in 250 ml of glucose. For children under 20 kg, administer each dose of quinine in a volume of 10 ml/kg of glucose. Do not administer a loading dose to patients who have received oral quinine, or mefloquine within the previous 24 hours: start with maintenance dose. Treat parenterally for at least 24 hours, then, if the patient can tolerate the oral route, change to a complete 3-day course of an ACT (or if not available, oral quinine to complete 7 days of quinine treatment). If not, continue parenteral treatment until the patient can change to oral route (without exceeding 7 days of parenteral treatment). Page 18 4/ 409
