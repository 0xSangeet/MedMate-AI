in some national protocols. Prevention For pregnant women in areas with high risk of infection with P. falciparum, refer to the guide Essential obstetric and newborn care, MSF. In areas with seasonal malaria transmission (in particular across the Sahel sub-region), seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children < 5 years reduces mortality: administer amodiaquine + SP at monthly intervals for 4 months during the transmission period [4] . In malaria endemic areas and in epidemic-prone contexts, all in-patient facilities (including HIV treatment centres and feeding centres), should be furnished with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). For more information, refer to the guide Public health engineering, MSF. See specialised literature for information regarding anti-vector measures and prevention in travellers. Footnotes (a) Most rapid tests detect the following antigens alone or in combination: HRP2 protein specific to P. falciparum; an enzyme (Pf pLDH) specific to P. falciparum; an enzyme (pan pLDH) common to all 4 plasmodium species. HRP2 may continue to be detectable for 6 weeks or more after parasite clearance; pLDH remains detectable for several days (up to 2 weeks) after parasite clearance. Use pan pLDH tests as first choice in hyper and holo-endemic areas, as well as in areas of intense seasonal transmission and during outbreaks or complex emergencies. In other contexts, HRP2 tests (P. falciparum > 95%) or HRP2 + pLDH combination tests (P. falciparum < 95%) are preferred. (b) If the patient vomits within 30 minutes after administration: re-administer the full dose. If the patient vomits between 30 minutes and 1 hour after administration, re-administer half of the dose. If severe vomiting precludes oral therapy, manage as severe malaria, see Treatment of severe malaria. Page 18 6/ 409
