Treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria b In low malaria endemic areas, in addition to ACT, all individuals (except in children < 30 kg, pregnant women or breastfeeding women of infants aged < 6 months) diagnosed with P. falciparum malaria, should be given a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg primaquine to reduce the risk of transmission [3] . Notes: In infants below the age/weight mentioned in the table above, there is little data on efficacy and safety of ACTs. The combinations AL, AS/AQ and DHA/PPQ can be used. The dose should be calculated so as to correspond to 10-16 mg/kg/dose of lumefantrine; 10 mg/kg daily of amodiaquine; 20 mg/kg daily of piperaquine. Clinical condition of young children can deteriorate rapidly; it may be preferable to start parenteral treatment straight away (see below). Quinine PO is not recommended as standard treatment, however still remains in some national protocols: quinine PO for 7 days b Children and adults under 50 kg: 10 mg/kg 3 times daily Adults 50 kg and over: 600 mg 3 times daily Symptomatic treatment Paracetamol PO in the event of high fever only (Fever, Chapter 1). Treatment of severe malaria The patient must be hospitalised. Antimalarial treatment Page 18 3/ 409
