Children under 12 years: 150 mg/kg every 6 hours for 14 days Children 12 years and over and adults: 100 mg/kg every 6 hours for 14 days In the event of a relapse after NECT or eflornithine: melarsoprol slow IV Children and adults: 2.2 mg/kg once daily for 10 days Melarsoprol is highly toxic: reactive encephalopathy (coma, or recurrent or prolonged seizures) in 5 to 10% of treated patients, fatal in around 50% of cases; peripheral neuropathy, invasive diarrhoea, severe skin rash, phlebitis, etc. Prednisolone PO (1 mg/kg once daily) is frequently combined throughout the duration of treatment. Rhodesiense HAT melarsoprol slow IV Children and adults: 2.2 mg/kg once daily for 10 days Prednisolone PO (1 mg/kg once daily) is frequently combined throughout the duration of treatment. Treatment in pregnant women All trypanocides are potentially toxic for the mother and the foetus (risk of miscarriage, malformation, etc.). However, due to the life-threatening risk for the mother and the risk of mother-to-child transmission, treatment must be initiated as follows: Haemolymphatic stage: pentamidine for gambiense HAT as of the second trimester and suramin for rhodesiense HAT. Meningoencephalitic stage: treatment depends on the mother's condition: If in immediately life-threatening condition: treatment with NECT or eflornithine cannot be deferred until after delivery. If not immediately life-threatening condition: pentamidine for gambiense HAT and suramin for rhodesiense HAT. Treatment with NECT or eflornithine is to be administered after delivery. Prevention and control Individual protection against tsetse fly bites: long sleeves and trousers, repellents, keeping away from risk areas (e.g. near rivers). Disease control: mass screening and treatment of patients (T.b. gambiense), trypanocide treatment of cattle (T.b. rhodesiense), vector control using tsetse fly traps or insecticides. Page 19 0/ 409
