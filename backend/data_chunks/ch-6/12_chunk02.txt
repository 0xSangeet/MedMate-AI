severe constipation. Individuals with immunosuppression have a higher risk of developing organ damage than the general population. Diagnosis Laboratory [1] Acute phase: Identification of Trypanosoma cruzi by direct microscopy of fresh blood or blood concentrated by microhematocrit method. In case of strong clinical suspicion despite no definitive diagnosis from direct microscopy, perform serologic tests after a delay of approximately 1 month (see "Chronic phase"). Chronic phase: Identification of anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies by serologic tests, e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI), indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) or rapid diagnostic test (RDT). For a definitive diagnosis, two different serological tests should be performed simultaneously; in case of conflicting results, a third test is recommended. b Other investigations ECG may demonstrate conduction disorders. Chest or abdominal x-ray may demonstrate cardiomegaly, megaoesophagus or megacolon. Treatment Page 19 1/ 409
