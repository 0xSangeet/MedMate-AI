Zinc sulfate is given in combination with oral rehydration solution in order to reduce the duration and severity of diarrhoea, as well as to prevent further occurrences in the 2 to 3 months after treatment: zinc sulfate PO Children under 6 months: 10 mg (Â½ tablet) once daily for 10 days Children from 6 months to 5 years: 20 mg (1 tablet) once daily for 10 days Place the half-tablet or full tablet in a teaspoon, add a bit of water to dissolve it, and give the entire spoonful to the child. Antimicrobial treatment Diarrhoea without blood Most acute diarrhoeas are caused by viruses unresponsive to antimicrobials. Antimicrobials can be beneficial in the event of cholera or giardiasis. Cholera: the most important part of treatment is rehydration. In the absence of resistance (perform antibiotic- sensitivity testing at the beginning of an outbreak), antibiotic treatment shortens the duration of diarrhoea. See the guide Management of a cholera epidemic, MSF. Giardiasis: see Intestinal protozoan infections, Chapter 6. Diarrhoea with blood Shigellosis is the most frequent cause of bloody diarrhoea (amoebiasis is much less common). If there is no laboratory diagnosis to confirm the presence of amoebae, first line treatment is for shigellosis (Chapter 3). Amoebiasis: antiparasitic treatment only if motile Entamoeba histolytica amoebae are found in stools or if a correct shigellosis treatment has been ineffective (see Amoebiasis, Chapter 3). Prevention Breastfeeding reduces infant morbidity and mortality from diarrhoea and the severity of diarrhoea episodes. When the child is weaned preparation and storage of food are associated with the risk of contamination by faecal micro-organisms: discourage bottle-feeding; food must be cooked well; milk or porridge must never be stored at room temperature. Access to sufficient amounts of clean water and personal hygiene (washing hands with soap and water before food preparation and
