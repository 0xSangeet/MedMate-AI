case of epilepsy, start or resume long-term treatment. See Epilepsy, Chapter 12. Postictal management Note time of end of seizure; keep patient in recovery position; maintain airway. Administer oxygen to all patients if available and especially to patients who received ASM(s). Maintain SpO > 94%. 2 Monitor vital signs and SpO every 15 minutes until stable, then every hour. 2 Closely monitor RR if the patient received BZD, PB or PHT; HR and BP (and ECG if available) if the patient received PHT. Observe for further seizures. As soon as possible, try to identify the underlying cause and treat it, even in patients with known epilepsy (see Frequent causes of seizures): Take a detailed history and perform a full clinical examination, looking particularly for general status and focal signs. Depending on assessment, perform the following tests if available: capillary blood glucose, especially if not done during the seizure. Check regularly blood glucose if necessary. rapid diagnostic test for malaria in endemic areas CSF examination (lumbar puncture) and culture white blood cell count, serum electrolytes and creatinine, liver enzymes and coagulation tests, blood culture Note if patient does not return to baseline status within 30 to 60 minutes of end of seizure. Frequent causes of seizures Febrile seizures: in young children with fever, usually in a context of a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection. CNS infections: e.g. any meningitis (for Bacterial meningitis, see Chapter 7); severe malaria, neurocysticercosis, trypanosomiasis (see Chapter 6); cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis (see HIV infection and AIDS, Chapter 8). Metabolic abnormalities: e.g. hypoglycaemia (Chapter 1), electrolyte disorders (hyponatremia, hypocalcaemia). Intoxications: e.g. psychoactive drugs and alcohol, methanol, medications, neurotoxic pesticides and venoms, carbon monoxide. Page 26 / 409
