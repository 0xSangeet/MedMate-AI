If patient does not return to full alertness after an episode of severe hypoglycaemia, monitor blood glucose levels regularly. Aetiological treatment Other than diabetes: Treat severe acute malnutrition, neonatal sepsis, severe malaria, acute alcohol intoxication, etc. End prolonged fast. Replace drugs inducing hypoglycaemia (e.g. quinine IV, pentamidine, ciprofloxacin, enalapril, beta-blockers, high- dose aspirin, tramadol), or anticipate hypoglycaemia (e.g. administer quinine IV in a glucose infusion). In diabetic patients: Avoid missing meals, increase intake of carbohydrates if necessary. Adjust dosage of insulin according to blood glucose levels and physical activity. Adjust dosage of oral antidiabetics, taking into account possible drug interactions.
