Discharge criteria In general: Children can be discharged from hospital and be treated as outpatients if the following criteria are met: clinically well; medical complications controlled; able to eat RUTF (observed during appetite test); reduction or absence of oedema; caregiver feels able to provide care as outpatient; vaccinations up to date or referral to vaccination service organised. Children can be discharged from nutritional treatment if the following criteria are met: co-existing medical conditions stable and outpatient treatment organised if necessary (e.g. dressing changes, follow-up for chronic diseases); vaccinations up to date or referral to vaccination service organised; absence of oedema and WHZ > â€“2 or MUAC > 125 mm for at least 2 weeks. Discharge criteria vary with context. Refer to national recommendations. Footnotes (a) MUAC is measured at the mid-point of the left upper arm. The arm should be relaxed. The measuring tape should be in contact with the skin all around the arm, without exerting pressure. (b) For WHZ, see WHO simplified field tables in z-scores for girls and for boys: https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/standards/weight-for-length-height (c) ReSoMal is a specific oral rehydration solution for malnourished children, containing less sodium and more potassium than standard ORS. It should be administered under medical supervision to avoid overdosing and hyponatremia. (d) Remove 50 ml of Ringer lactate (RL) from a 500 ml RL bottle or bag, then add 50 ml of 50% glucose to the remaining 450 ml of RL to obtain 500 ml of 5% glucose-RL solution. References 1.
