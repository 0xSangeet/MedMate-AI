Chronic asthma Last updated: June 2023 Clinical features Asthma should be suspected in patients with recurrent respiratory symptoms (wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath and/or cough) of variable frequency, severity and duration, disturbing sleep, and causing the patient to sit up to breathe. These symptoms may appear during or after exercise. Chest auscultation may be normal or demonstrate diffuse sibilant wheezes. A personal or family history of atopy (eczema, allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis) or a family history of asthma increases probability of asthma but their absence does not exclude asthma. Patients with typical symptoms of asthma and a history of disease that is characteristic of asthma should be considered as having asthma after exclusion of other diagnoses. Any identified asthma risk factor (e.g. allergen, pollution, tobacco smoke exposure) should be eliminated where possible. The assessment of the frequency of symptoms and limitations of daily activities determines the treatment. Treatment The mainstay of long-term treatment are inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABA). LABAs should never be used alone but always in combination with an ICS. Combination inhalers are preferred, when available. In addition to long-term treatment, salbutamol (short-acting beta-2 agonist, SABA) and combination inhalers can be used to reduce bronchoconstriction if the patient is symptomatic. Treatment is started at the step most appropriate to initial severity then, re-evaluated and adjusted according to clinical response. An intervening severe asthma attack or loss of control necessitates treatment reassessment. The inhaler is chosen according to age. In children, a spacer should be used. Instructions on inhaler technique and information on asthma attack symptoms should be provided.
