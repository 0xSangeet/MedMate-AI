fluid behind an intact tympanic membrane, in the absence of signs and symptoms of acute infection, is suggestive of otitis media with effusion (OME). Complications, particularly in high-risk children (malnutrition, immunodeficiency, ear malformation) include chronic suppurative otitis media, and rarely, mastoiditis, brain abscess or meningitis. Treatment In all cases: Treatment of fever and pain: paracetamol PO (Chapter 1). Ear irrigation is contra-indicated if the tympanic membrane is ruptured, or when the tympanic membrane cannot be fully visualised. Ear drops are not indicated. Indications for antibiotic therapy: Antibiotics are prescribed in children less than 2 years, children whose assessment suggests severe infection (vomiting, fever > 39 Â°C, severe pain) and children at risk of unfavourable outcome (malnutrition, immunodeficiency, ear malformation). For other children: If the child can be re-examined within 48 to 72 hours: it is preferable to delay antibiotic prescription. Spontaneous resolution is probable and a short symptomatic treatment of fever and pain may be sufficient. Antibiotics are prescribed if there is no improvement or worsening of symptoms after 48 to 72 hours. If the child cannot be re-examined: antibiotics are prescribed. For children treated with antibiotics: advise the mother to bring the child back if fever and pain persist after 48 hours. Choice of antibiotherapy: Amoxicillin is the first-line treatment: amoxicillin PO for 5 days Children: 30 mg/kg 3 times daily (max. 3 g daily) Adults: 1 g 3 times daily Page 82 / 409
