If seizures do not stop, continue treatment as for patients with no known epilepsy. If seizures stop after 1 or 2 second-line ASM(s), see Postictal management and Maintenance ASM treatment. Step 3 - Maintenance ASM treatment Some patients may require maintenance treatment after the loading dose. In children, maintenance treatment is indicated when: a second-line ASM has been used to control seizures, unless a reversible cause of seizure can be quickly treated (e.g. hypoglycaemia, electrolyte disturbances), 3 or more seizures occur within a 24-hour period, focal signs and/or impaired consciousness persist beyond expected postictal period, there is known or presumed traumatic brain injury (within 24 hours of injury), there is known or presumed epilepsy. Unless the child has already received a loading dose, start with a loading dose, see Table 3. In adults, maintenance treatment is indicated for all patients, unless a reversible cause of seizure can be quickly treated (e.g. hypoglycaemia, electrolyte disturbances). If seizures do not recur, administer maintenance treatment for 48 to 72 hours and then reassess. Use oral route (or nasogastric tube). For maintenance doses to be administered, see Table 3. For seizures in the context of head trauma, maintenance treatment should last 7 days. In case of epilepsy, start or resume long-term treatment. See Epilepsy, Chapter 12. Postictal management Note time of end of seizure; keep patient in recovery position; maintain airway. Administer oxygen to all patients if available and especially to patients who received ASM(s). Maintain SpO > 94%. 2 Monitor vital signs and SpO every 15 minutes until stable, then every hour. 2 Closely monitor RR if the patient received BZD, PB or PHT; HR and BP (and ECG if available) if the patient received PHT. Observe for further seizures. As soon as possible, try to identify the underlying cause and treat it,
