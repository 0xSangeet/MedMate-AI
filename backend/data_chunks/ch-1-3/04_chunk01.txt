(d) In patients ≥ 65 years: for diazepam rectal, do not exceed 2 ml (= 10 mg) per dose; for diazepam IV, reduce the dose by half (1 ml = 5 mg per dose). Step 2 - Second-line ASM treatment Patients with no known epilepsy Second-line ASMs are indicated for: Children, if seizures do not stop within 5 minutes of second dose of BZD. All adults, even if seizures stop after 1 or 2 doses of BZD, unless a reversible cause of seizure can be quickly treated (e.g. hypoglycaemia, electrolyte disturbances). The choice of the ASM depends on the patient’s characteristics: age, sex, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, and comorbidities. See Table 2. For doses to be administered, see Table 3 Table 2 - Choice of a second-line antiseizure medication Children 1 month to < 2 years Girls 2 to < 10 years Girls ≥ 10 years and women Boys ≥ 2 years and men First choice levetiracetam (LEV) (e) levetiracetam (LEV) (e) or valproic acid (VPA) (f) Second choice phenobarbital (PB) (g) phenobarbital (PB) (g) Third choice phenytoin (PHT) (h) phenytoin (PHT) (h) (e) LEV can be used in all patients but with caution in patients with renal impairment or heart disorders. (f) VPA is contraindicated: • in children under 2 years and patients with hepatic disease; • in women and girls who are or may become pregnant. Every effort should be made to find a safer alternative to VPA in pregnant women and girls. However, prolonged status epilepticus is a life-threatening condition both for the mother and the unborn child. If VPA is the only ASM available, use the lowest possible dose. (g) PB is contraindicated in patients with severe impairment of respiratory, renal or hepatic function. It should be administered with caution in children, older patients and patients
