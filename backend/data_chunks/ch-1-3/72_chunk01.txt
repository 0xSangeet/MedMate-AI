Outpatient treatment Nasal irrigation with 0.9% NaCl before each feeding (demonstrate the technique to the mother) a . Small, frequent feedings to reduce vomiting triggered by bouts of coughing. Increased fluids if fever and/or significant secretions are present. Treat fever (Chapter 1). Handle the patient the patient as little as possible and avoid unnecessary procedures. Hospitalisation In all cases: Place the infant in a semi-reclining position (± 30°). Nasal irrigation, small, frequent feeds, treatment of fever: as for outpatient treatment. Gentle oro-pharyngeal suction if needed. Monitor fluid intake: normal requirements are 80 to 100 ml/kg/day + 20 to 25 ml/kg/day with high fever or very profuse secretions. According to symptoms: Humidified nasal oxygen if respiratory distress or SpO < 92%. 2 When there is vomiting or significant fatigue when sucking, fluid requirements may be administered by nasogastric tube (small volumes on a frequent basis) or the IV route, for the shortest possible time. Avoid breastfeeding or oral feeds in children with severe tachypnoea, but do not prolong NG feeds (respiratory compromise) or IV infusions any longer than necessary. Bronchodilator therapy is not indicated but a trial treatment may be given in case of severe respiratory distress (salbutamol metered-dose inhaler, 100 micrograms/puff: 2 to 3 puffs with spacer, repeated 2 times at an interval of 30 minutes). If inhaled salbutamol appears effective in relieving symptoms, the treatment is continued (2 to 3 puffs every 6 hours in the acute phase, then gradual reduction as recovery takes place). If the trial is ineffective, the treatment is discontinued. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is concern about complications such as secondary bacterial pneumonia. Prevention and control The risk of transmission of the virus is increased in hospital settings: Children with bronchiolitis should be grouped together, away from other children (cohorting). As infection is
