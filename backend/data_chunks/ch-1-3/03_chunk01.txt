Check whether a BZD has been administered before arrival at the hospital and the number of doses. If one dose was administered, give a second dose. If 2 doses were administered, start Step 2 - Second-line ASM treatment. If no pre-hospital dose of BZD was administered: If IV or IO access: diazepam (5 mg/ml solution) by slow IV injection (over 3 to 5 minutes). For doses to be administered, see Table 1. If no IV or IO access: midazolam (5 mg/ml solution) by buccal or intranasal route or midazolam (1 mg/ml solution) by IM route or diazepam (5 mg/ml solution) by rectal route. For doses to be administered, see Table 1. If seizures do not stop 5 minutes after the first dose of BZD, readminister the same dose. If seizures do not stop after the second dose of BZD, start Step 2 - Second-line ASM treatment. If seizures recur: 6 hours or more after seizures stop, restart treatment from Step 1 - First-line ASM treatment as for a new seizure, Less than 6 hours after seizures stop, continue treatment at the last point, e.g.: if seizures recur < 6 hours after a first dose of BZD, readminister the same dose, if seizures recur < 6 hours after 2 doses of BZD, start Step 2 - Second-line ASM treatment. If seizures stop after 1 or 2 doses of BZD and do not recur, see Postictal management and evaluate the need for maintenance ASM treatment.
