Rhinitis and rhinopharyngitis (common cold) Rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mucosa) and rhinopharyngitis (inflammation of the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa) are generally benign, self-limited and most often of viral origin. However, they may be an early sign of another infection (e.g. measles or influenza) or may be complicated by a bacterial infection (e.g. otitis media or sinusitis). Clinical features Nasal discharge or obstruction, which may be accompanied by sore throat, fever, cough, lacrimation, and diarrhoea in infants. Purulent nasal discharge is not indicative of a secondary bacterial infection. In children under 5 years, routinely check the tympanic membranes to look for an associated otitis media. Treatment Antibiotherapy is not recommended: it does not promote recovery nor prevent complications. Treatment is symptomatic: Clear the nose with 0.9% sodium chloride a . Fever, throat soreness: paracetamol PO for 2 to 3 days (Fever, Chapter 1). Footnotes (a) For a child: place him on his back, head turned to the side, and instil 0.9% sodium chloride into each nostril. Page 65 / 409
