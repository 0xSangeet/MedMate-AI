Spots on oral mucosa (Koplik’s spots) accompanied by conjunctivitis and skin rash (see Measles, Chapter 8). “Strawberry” (red and bumpy) tongue accompanied by a skin rash: scarlet fever caused by GAS. Local complications: Peritonsillar, retropharyngeal or lateral pharyngeal abscess: fever, intense pain, dysphagia, hoarse voice, trismus (limitation of mouth opening), unilateral deviation of the uvula. General complications: Complications due to the toxin: diphtheria (see Diphtheria, Chapter 2). Poststreptococcal complications: ARF, acute glomerulonephritis. Signs of serious illness in children: severe dehydration, severe difficulty swallowing, upper airway compromise, deterioration of general condition. Differential diagnosis: epiglottitis (see Epiglottitis, Chapter 2). Treatment Symptomatic treatment (fever and pain): paracetamol or ibuprofen PO (Fever, Chapter 1). Centor score ≤ 1: viral pharyngitis, which typically resolves within a few days (or weeks, for IM): no antibiotic treatment. Centor score ≥ 2 or scarlet fever: antibiotic treatment for GAS infections [3] : If single-use injection equipment is available, benzathine benzylpenicillin is the drug of choice as streptococcus A resistance to penicillin remains rare; it is the only antibiotic proven effective in reducing the incidence of rheumatic fever; and the treatment is administered as a single dose. benzathine benzylpenicillin IM Children under 30 kg (or under 10 years): 600 000 IU single dose Children 30 kg and over (or 10 years and over) and adults: 1.2 MIU single dose Penicillin V is the oral reference treatment, but poor adherence is predictable due to the length of treatment. phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) PO for 10 days Children 1 to < 6 years: 250 mg 2 times daily Children 6 to < 12 years: 500 mg 2 times daily Children 12 years and over and adults: 1 g 2 times daily Children under 1 year: 125 mg 2 times daily Amoxicillin is an alternative and the treatment has the advantage of being
