Epiglottitis Bacterial infection of the epiglottis in young children caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), it is rare when Hib vaccine coverage is high. It can be caused by other bacteria and occur in adults. Clinical features Rapid (less than 12-24 hours) onset of high fever. Typical “tripod or sniffing” position, preferring to sit, leaning forward with an open mouth, anxious appearing. Difficulty swallowing, drooling, and respiratory distress. Stridor may be present (as opposed to croup, hoarse voice and cough are usually absent). Critically ill appearing a . Allow the child to sit in a comfortable position or on the parent’s lap. Do not force them to lie down (may precipitate airway obstruction). Avoid any examination that will upset the child including examination of the mouth and throat. Treatment In case of imminent airway obstruction, emergency intubation or tracheotomy is indicated. The intubation is technically difficult and should be performed under anaesthesia by a physician familiar with the procedure. Be prepared to perform a tracheotomy if intubation is unsuccessful. In all cases: Insert a peripheral IV line and provide IV hydration. Antibiotherapy: ceftriaxone slow IV (3 minutes) or IV infusion (30 minutes) b . Avoid IM route (may agitate the child and precipitate a respiratory arrest). Children: 50 mg/kg once daily Adults: 1 g once daily The IV treatment is administered for at least 5 days then, if the clinical condition has improved c and oral treatment can be tolerated, change to: amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) PO to complete a total of 7 to 10 days of treatment. Use formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1 exclusively. The dose is expressed in amoxicillin: Children < 40 kg: 50 mg/kg 2 times daily Children ≥ 40 kg and adult: Ratio 8:1: 3000 mg daily (2 tablets of 500/62.5 mg 3 times daily)
