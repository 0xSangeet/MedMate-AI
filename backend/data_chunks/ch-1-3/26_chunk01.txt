Malaria: see Malaria (Chapter 6). In the event of associated iron deficiency, wait 4 weeks after malaria treatment before prescribing iron supplements. Suspected haemolytic anaemia: stop any drug that causes haemolysis in patients with (or that may possibly have) G6PD deficiency. Blood transfusion Indications To decide whether to transfuse, several parameters should be taken into account: Clinical tolerance of anaemia Underlying conditions (cardiovascular disease, infection, etc.) Rate at which anaemia develops. Hb levels If transfusion is indicated, it should be carried out without delay b . For transfusion thresholds, see Table 2. Volume to be transfused If presence of haemorrhagic shock: see Shock, Chapter 1. Otherwise: Children [3] : Transfusion volume is based on presence or absence of fever at any point from the time of ordering blood to the time of transfusion: If no fever (axillary temperature ≤ 37.5 °C) c : administer either 15 ml/kg of packed red blood cells (PRBC) over 3 hours or 30 ml/kg of whole blood over 4 hours If fever (axillary temperature > 37.5 °C) c : administer either 10 ml/kg of PRBC over 3 hours or 20 ml/kg of whole blood over 4 hours Adolescents and adults: start with an adult unit of PRBC or whole blood; do not exceed a transfusion rate of 5 ml/kg/hour. Repeat if necessary, depending on clinical condition. Monitoring Monitor the patient’s condition and vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature): During the transfusion: 5 minutes after the start of transfusion, then every 15 minutes during the first hour, then every 30 minutes until the end of the transfusion. After the transfusion: 4 to 6 hours after the end of the transfusion. Pay attention to signs of transfusion reaction, fluid overload, decompensation or continuing blood loss. For children: measure Hb once between 8 and 24
