Croup (laryngotracheitis and laryngotracheobronchitis) Last updated: October 2024 Common viral respiratory infection with peak incidence amongst children between 6 months and 3 years. Clinical features Typical barking cough, hoarse voice or cry. Inspiratory stridor (abnormal high pitched sound on inspiration): Croup is considered mild if the stridor only occurs with agitation; Croup is considered severe if there is stridor at rest, especially when it is accompanied by respiratory distress. Wheezing may also be present if the bronchi are involved. Treatment In the absence of inspiratory stridor or intercostal, subcostal or sternal retractions, treat symptomatically: ensure adequate hydration, seek medical attention if symptoms worsen (e.g. respiratory difficulty, noisy breathing, inability to tolerate oral fluids). If stridor is only present with agitation (mild croup) [1] : Assure adequate hydration. Corticosteroids: dexamethasone PO: 0.15 to 0.6 mg/kg (max. 16 mg) a single dose or, if not available, prednisolone PO: 1 mg/kg single dose Keep the child under observation at least 30 minutes after oral corticosteroid. Consider hospitalisation or longer observation (> 4 hours) if the child is less than 6 months old, or is dehydrated, or lives far from health facility. If danger signs are present (stridor at rest, respiratory distress, hypoxia) or the child is unable to drink, admit to hospital [1] : Administer oxygen continuously if respiratory distress or SpO < 92%: maintain SpO between 94 and 98% (or if 2 2 SpO cannot be determined, at least 5 litres/minute). 2 Insert a peripheral IV line and provide IV hydration. Epinephrine (adrenaline) via nebulizer [2] b : 0.5 mg/kg (max. 5 mg) to be repeated every 20 minutes if danger signs persist (see table below). Monitor heart rate during nebulization (if heart rate greater than 200, stop the nebulization). Weight 6 kg 7 kg 8 kg 9 kg 10-17 kg Dose
