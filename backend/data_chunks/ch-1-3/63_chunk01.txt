Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) Chronic bacterial infection of the middle ear with persistent purulent discharge through a perforated tympanic membrane. The principal causative organisms are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp, staphylococcus, other Gram negative and anaerobic bacteria. Clinical features Purulent discharge for more than 2 weeks, often associated with hearing loss or even deafness; absence of pain and fever Otoscopy: perforation of the tympanic membrane and purulent exudate Complications: Consider a superinfection (AOM) in the case of new onset of fever with ear pain, and treat accordingly. Consider mastoiditis in the case of new onset of high fever, severe ear pain and/or tender swelling behind the ear, in a patient who appears significantly unwell. Consider brain abscess or meningitis in the case of impaired consciousness, neck stiffness and focal neurological signs (e.g. facial nerve paralysis). Treatment Remove secretions from the auditory canal by gentle dry mopping (use a dry cotton bud or a small piece of dry cotton wool). Apply ciprofloxacin ear drops until no more drainage is obtained (approximately 2 weeks, max. 4 weeks): Children 1 year and over: 3 drops 2 times daily Adults: 4 drops 2 times daily Complications: Chronic mastoiditis is a medical emergency that requires prompt hospitalisation, prolonged antibiotherapy that covers the causative organisms of CSOM (ceftriaxone IM for 10 days + ciprofloxacin PO for 14 days), atraumatic cleaning of the ear canal; surgical treatment may be required. Before transfer to hospital, if the patient needs to be transferred, administer the first dose of antibiotics. Meningitis (Chapter 7). Page 84 / 409
