Management of foreign body aspiration Acute airway obstruction (the foreign body either completely obstructs the pharynx or acts as a valve on the laryngeal inlet), no warning signs, most frequently in a child 6 months-5 years playing with a small object or eating. Conscience is initially maintained. Perform maneuvers to relieve obstruction only if the patient cannot speak or cough or emit any sound: Children over 1 year and adults: Heimlich manoeuvre: stand behind the patient. Place a closed fist in the pit of the stomach, above the navel and below the ribs. Place the other hand over fist and press hard into the abdomen with a quick, upward thrust. Perform one to five abdominal thrusts in order to compress the lungs from the below and dislodge the foreign body. Children under 1 year: Place the infant face down across the forearm (resting the forearm on the leg) and support the infantâ€™s head with the hand. With the heel of the other hand, perform one to five slaps on the back, between shoulder plates. If unsuccessful, turn the infant on their back. Perform five forceful sternal compressions as in cardiopulmonary resuscitation: use 2 or 3 fingers in the center of the chest just below the nipples. Press down approximately one- third the depth of the chest (about 3 to 4 cm). Repeat until the foreign body is expelled and the patient resumes spontaneous breathing (coughing, crying, talking). If the patient loses consciousness ventilate and perform cardiopulmonary rescucitation. Tracheostomy if unable to ventilate.
