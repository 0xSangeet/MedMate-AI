Gastro-oesophageal reflux Clinical features Burning stomachache or heartburn, generally relieved by antacids; acid regurgitation (often postural: while sitting forward or lying down). In the absence of dysphagia (oesophageal stenosis), these signs are benign. Treatment First instance: encourage the patient to avoid alcohol and tobacco use. Give aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide PO (400 mg/400 mg tablet) a : 1 to 2 tablets 3 times daily 20 minutes to one hour after meals, or 1 tablet during painful attacks. If antacids are insufficient: omeprazole PO: 20 mg once daily in the morning for 3 days In young children: no drug treatment, rest and sleep on an incline (30° to 45°).
