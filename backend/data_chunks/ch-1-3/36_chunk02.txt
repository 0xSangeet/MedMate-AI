infection as above. Check blood glucose level and treat for hypoglycaemia if necessary (see Hypoglycaemia, Chapter 1). In children with kwashiorkor, infection of cutaneous lesions is common and may progress to soft tissue or systemic infection. If cutaneous infection is present, stop amoxicillin and start amoxicillin/clavulanic acid PO. Use formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1. The dose is expressed in amoxicillin: 50 mg/kg 2 times daily for 7 days. Severe anaemia Children with Hb < 4 or < 6 with signs of decompensation (such as respiratory distress) or ongoing blood loss require transfusion within the first 24 hours. See Anaemia (Chapter 1) for volume to be transfused and patient monitoring during and after transfusion. Preferably use packed red blood cells (PRBC), if available. Monitor closely for signs of fluid overload (see box below). Diarrhoea and dehydration Diarrhoea is common. Therapeutic foods facilitate the recovery of physiological function of the gastrointestinal tract. Amoxicillin administered as part of routine treatment reduces intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Diarrhoea generally resolves without additional treatment. If an aetiological treatment is necessary, see Acute diarrhoea, Chapter 3. Zinc supplementation is not needed if children consume recommended amounts of therapeutic foods. The diagnosis of dehydration is based on history and clinical features. Clinical assessment is difficult in children with SAM as delayed skin pinch test and sunken eyes are often present even in the absence of dehydration. For classification of degree of dehydration adapted for children with SAM, see table below: Page 57 / 409
