ReSoMal to 10 ml/kg/hour until the signs of dehydration and/or weight loss (known or estimated) have been corrected. Assess every 2 hours. Once there are no signs of dehydration and/or the target weight is reached, change to Plan A SAM to prevent dehydration. If no improvement after 2 to 4 hours or if oral rehydration cannot compensate for losses: change to Plan C SAM "with circulatory impairment". Continue feeding including breastfeeding. Monitor for signs of fluid overload (see box below). Regardless of the target weight, stop rehydration if signs of fluid overload appear.
