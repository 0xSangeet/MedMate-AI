micrograms/puff: 2 to 3 puffs with spacer, repeated 2 times at an interval of 30 minutes). If inhaled salbutamol appears effective in relieving symptoms, the treatment is continued (2 to 3 puffs every 6 hours in the acute phase, then gradual reduction as recovery takes place). If the trial is ineffective, the treatment is discontinued. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is concern about complications such as secondary bacterial pneumonia. Prevention and control The risk of transmission of the virus is increased in hospital settings: Children with bronchiolitis should be grouped together, away from other children (cohorting). As infection is most commonly transmitted by the hands, the most important prevention measure is hand-washing after any contact with patients, and objects or surfaces in contact with patients on which the virus may survive for several hours. In addition, staff should wear gowns, gloves and surgical masks when in contact with patients.
