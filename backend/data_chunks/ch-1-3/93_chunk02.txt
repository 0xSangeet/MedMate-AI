or treat dehydration: rehydration consists of prompt replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses as required, until the diarrhoea stops. Administer zinc sulfate to children under 5 years. Prevent malnutrition. Do not systematically administer antimicrobials: only certain diarrhoeas require antibiotics (see Antimicrobial treatment). Do not administer anti-diarrhoeal drugs or antiemetics. Treat the underlying condition if any (malaria, otitis, respiratory infection, etc.). Prevention and treatment of dehydration See Dehydration, Chapter 1. Adapted treatment protocols are recommended for children with malnutrition (see Severe acute malnutrition, Chapter 1). Prevention of malnutrition Continue unrestricted normal diet. In breastfed children, increase the frequency of feeds. Breast milk does not replace ORS. ORS should be given between feeds.
