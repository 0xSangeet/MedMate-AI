heart disorders. (f) VPA is contraindicated: • in children under 2 years and patients with hepatic disease; • in women and girls who are or may become pregnant. Every effort should be made to find a safer alternative to VPA in pregnant women and girls. However, prolonged status epilepticus is a life-threatening condition both for the mother and the unborn child. If VPA is the only ASM available, use the lowest possible dose. (g) PB is contraindicated in patients with severe impairment of respiratory, renal or hepatic function. It should be administered with caution in children, older patients and patients with mild to moderate impairment of respiratory, renal or hepatic function. (h) PHT is contraindicated in patients with bradycardia, atrioventricular block. It should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, heart failure, cardiac rhythm disorders, hypotension. If seizures do not stop after second-line ASM, change to another second-line ASM. If seizures do not stop or recur in < 6 hours despite 2 second-line ASMs, transfer the patient to an intensive care unit for treatment of refractory status epilepticus. If seizures stop after 1 or 2 second-line ASM(s), see Postictal management and Maintenance ASM treatment. Patients with known epilepsy History taking: ASM and dose taken, effectiveness. Missed doses if any, and reason (e.g. forgetting, interruption due to adverse effects, shortage of medication). Management: Administer the IV loading dose of the medication that the patient should usually take or see Table 2. Page 25 / 409
