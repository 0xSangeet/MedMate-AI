acute pain (see Pain, Chapter 1); omeprazole IV infusion: 40 mg once daily over 20 to 30 minutes Refer to a surgeon. If referral not possible, risk of mortality is high: Continue conservative management including maintenance fluid (alternate 5% glucose and Ringer lactate). Start IV antibiotics (see Shock, Chapter 1). If after 3 days, the patient's clinical condition has improved, cautiously restart oral feeding, remove the nasogastric tube and start PO treatment to eradicate Helicobacter pylori (see eradication of Helicobacter pylori). Gastrointestinal bleeding Passing of black stool (maelena) and/or vomiting blood (haematemesis). In 80% of cases the bleeding stops spontaneously. Insert a nasogastric tube for aspiration and insert an IV line (16G). If the haemodynamic state is stable (pulse and blood pressure are normal): Hydrate (Ringer lactate), monitor, keep NPO for 12 hours. If there is no active haemorrhage, restart oral feeding after 12 hours. Gastric lavage with cold water is not essential, but may help evaluate persistence of bleeding. If the haemorrhage continues (haematemesis) and/or if the haemodynamic state deteriorates (pulse increases, BP drops): Page 12 2/ 409
