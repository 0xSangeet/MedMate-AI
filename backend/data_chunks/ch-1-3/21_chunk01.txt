Notes on the use of morphine and derivatives: Morphine is an effective treatment for many types of severe pain. Its analgesic effect is dosedependent. Its adverse effects have often been exaggerated and should not be an obstacle to its use. The most serious adverse effect of morphine is respiratory depression, which may be fatal. This adverse effect results from overdose. It is, therefore, important to increase doses gradually. Respiratory depression is preceded by drowsiness, which is a warning to monitor respiratory rate (RR). The RR should remain equal to or greater than the thresholds
