Generalised tonic-clonic seizures and convulsive status epilepticus Last updated: October 2024 Generalised tonic-clonic seizures are involuntary movements of both sides of the body associated with impaired or loss of consciousness. They result from abnormal brain activity. Most seizures are brief (less than 5 minutes) and resolve spontaneously. They may occur once or may recur. In young children, seizures frequently occur in the context of fever, with no underlying causes. These are defined as "febrile seizures". A seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes or 2 or more seizures in 5 minutes without complete restoration of baseline consciousness between seizures is defined as "status epilepticus" [1] [2] . Status epilepticus is a medical emergency requiring immediate management. The longer a seizure lasts, the more difficult it is to stop, and the greater the risk for permanent brain damage and death. In pregnancy and the postpartum period, seizures may be a manifestation of eclampsia. Refer to Essential obstetric and newborn care, MSF. Clinical features During a seizure contraction of muscles, including respiratory muscles (tonic phase), followed by rhythmic jerking of the arms and legs (clonic phase) and loss of consciousness These signs may be associated with loss of urine, breathing difficulty, and cyanosis. Immediately after a seizure (postictal phase) The patient experiences fatigue and temporary symptoms such as confusional state, headache, memory loss, focal deficits. Recovery usually occurs within 30 to 60 minutes [3] but may be delayed. First aid during a seizure Note the time. Call for help. Protect from falls and trauma, loosen clothing. Maintain airway, place patient in recovery position to avoid aspiration, do not put anything in the mouth. Treat hypoglycaemia if present or administer glucose if unable to measure capillary blood glucose immediately (see Hypoglycaemia, Chapter 1). Depending on the context: Administer oxygen if available.
