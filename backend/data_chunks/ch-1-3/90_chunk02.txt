and point-of-care, urine LF-LAM (lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay) [2] . Treatment For pulmonary tuberculosis, the standard treatment is a combination of four antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol). The regimen is organised into 2 phases (initial phase and continuation phase) and lasts 6 months. If the strain is drug-resistant, the treatment is longer and different drug combinations are used. It takes significant investment to cure tuberculosis, both from the patient and the medical team. Only uninterrupted treatment will lead to cure and prevent the development of resistance. It is essential that the patient understands the importance of treatment adherence and has access to correct case management until treatment is completed.
