the throat. Signs of respiratory diphtheria a : pharyngitis, rhinopharyngitis, tonsillitis or laryngitis with tough, greyish, firmly adherent pseudo-membranes of the pharynx, nasopharynx, tonsils, or larynx; dysphagia and cervical adenitis, at times progressing to massive swelling of the neck; airway obstruction and possible suffocation when the infection extends to the nasal passages, larynx, trachea and bronchi; fever is generally low-grade [2] . Generalised signs due to effects of the toxin: cardiac dysfunction (tachycardia, arrhythmias), severe myocarditis with heart failure and possibly cardiogenic shock (see Shock, Chapter 1) 3 to 7 days or 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease; neuropathies in 2 to 8 weeks after the onset of disease leading to nasal voice and difficulty with swallowing (paralysis of the soft palate), vision (ocular motor paralysis), breathing (paralysis of respiratory muscles) and ambulation (limb paralysis); oliguria, anuria and acute renal failure. Differential diagnoses: Epiglottitis and Acute pharyngitis, Chapter 2, Stomatitis, Chapter 3. Laboratory Diagnosis is confirmed by isolation of toxigenic C. diphtheriae by culture (and antibiotic susceptibility test) of swab specimens collected from the affected areas: throat (tonsils, pharyngeal mucosa, soft palate, exudate, ulcer, etc.), nasopharynx. The presence of the toxin is confirmed by PCR testing (detection of diphtheria toxin gene). Treatment Isolation of patients; standard, droplet, and contact precautions for medical staff. Page 71 / 409
