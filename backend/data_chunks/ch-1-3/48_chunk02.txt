000 IU single dose Children 30 kg and over (or 10 years and over) and adults: 1.2 MIU single dose Penicillin V is the oral reference treatment, but poor adherence is predictable due to the length of treatment. phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) PO for 10 days Children 1 to < 6 years: 250 mg 2 times daily Children 6 to < 12 years: 500 mg 2 times daily Children 12 years and over and adults: 1 g 2 times daily Children under 1 year: 125 mg 2 times daily Amoxicillin is an alternative and the treatment has the advantage of being relatively short. However, it can cause adverse skin reactions in patients with undiagnosed IM and thus should be avoided when IM has not been excluded amoxicillin PO for 6 days Children: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily Adults: 1 g 2 times daily Macrolides should be reserved for penicillin allergic patients as resistance to macrolides is frequent and their efficacy in the prevention of rheumatic fever has not been studied. azithromycin PO for 3 days Children: 20 mg/kg once daily (max. 500 mg daily) Adults: 500 mg once daily Gonococcal or syphilitic pharyngitis: as for genital gonorrhoea (Chapter 9) and syphilis (Chapter 9).
