stage (1 to 6 weeks): Cough of increasing severity, occuring in characteristic bouts (paroxysms) of a series of coughs during one exhalation, followed by a laboured inspiration causing a distinctive gasping sound (whoop), and/or post-tussive vomiting. No or low-grade fever. Apnoea and cyanosis (in infants). Prolonged cough, sometimes without paroxysms or whoop (particularly in older children and adults). Complications may include secondary bacterial pneumonia (new-onset fever can be an indicator), dehydration and malnutrition triggered by feeding difficulty due to cough and vomiting, seizures, encephalopathy, sudden death, intracranial bleeding, petechiae, rib fracture, hernia, rectal prolapse. Convalescent stage (weeks to months): Paroxysms of cough gradually decrease in frequency and severity. The disease is most severe, with a high risk of death, in infants. Adolescents and adults commonly have milder symptoms, but older adults, immunocompromised persons, and people with underlying respiratory conditions are at risk of severe disease and hospitalisation [4] . Pertussis is most contagious and antibiotic treatment is most beneficial during the catarrhal stage of the illness. Since this is also the period during which clinical symptoms and signs are non-specific, it is necessary to maintain a high index of suspicion with clues from the context. These include patients with any compatible symptoms and close contact with a suspected case or in a pertussis outbreak setting. Management Suspected cases Antibiotic treatment Page 85 / 409
