or sickle cell disease or severe malaria or serious bacterial infection or pre-existing heart disease (a) Immediate transfusion is not required in children 2 months to 12 years with Hb ≥ 4 g/dl and < 6 g/dl and no sign of decompensation or ongoing blood loss, provided that: • they are closely monitored (including Hb measurements at 8, 24 and 48 hours), and • transfusion preparation (blood grouping, etc.) is carried out without delay in case the child needs to be transfused later on. Footnotes (a) A coformulated tablet of ferrous salts/folic acid contains 185 mg of ferrous fumarate or sulfate (equivalent to 60 mg of elemental iron) and 400 micrograms of folic acid. A 200 mg tablet of ferrous fumarate or sulfate contains 65 mg of elemental iron. A 140 mg/5 ml syrup of ferrous fumarate contains 45 mg/5 ml of elemental iron. (b) Before transfusing: determine the recipient’s and potential donors’ blood groups/rhesus and carry out screening tests on the donor’s blood for HIV-1 and 2, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and, in endemic areas, malaria and Chagas disease. (c) Axillary temperature should be taken at the time of ordering blood and immediately prior to transfusion. References Page 49 / 409
