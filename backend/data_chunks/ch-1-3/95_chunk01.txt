Shigellosis Shigellosis is a highly contagious bacterial infection resulting in bloody diarrhoea. There are 4 serogroups of shigella: S. dysenteriae, S. sonnei, S. flexneri, S. boydii. S. dysenteriae type 1 (Sd1) is the only strain that causes large scale outbreaks. It has the highest case fatality rate (up to 10%). Patients at risk of death are children under 5 years, malnourished patients, children after measles, adults over 50 years. Clinical features Diarrhoea with bright red blood visible in stool a , with or without fever Abdominal and rectal pain frequent Signs of serious illness: fever above 39 Â°C; severe dehydration; seizures, altered mental status Complications (more frequent with Sd1): febrile seizures (5 to 30% of children), rectal prolapse (3%), septicaemia, intestinal obstruction or perforation, moderate to severe haemolytic uraemic syndrome Laboratory Shigellosis in an epidemic context: Confirm the causal agent (stool culture) and perform antibiotic sensitivity tests. Perform monthly culture and sensitivity tests (antibiotic resistance can develop rapidly, sometimes during the course of an outbreak). Treatment Patients with signs of serious illness or with life-threatening risk factors must be admitted as inpatients. Treat patients with neither signs of serious illness nor risk factors as outpatients. Antibiotherapy: First-line treatment ciprofloxacin PO for 3 days if the strain is sensitive Children: 15 mg/kg 2 times daily if there is no antibiotic sensitivity test (max. 1 g daily) if oral administration is possible Adults: 500 mg 2 times daily ceftriaxone IM for 3 days in patients with severe infection and/or oral Children: 50 to 100 mg/kg once daily administration is not possible (max. 1 g daily) in pregnant women b Adults: 1 to 2 g once daily If resistance or contra-indication to ciprofloxacin or if no improvement within 48 hours of starting first-line treatment: Page 11 6/ 409
