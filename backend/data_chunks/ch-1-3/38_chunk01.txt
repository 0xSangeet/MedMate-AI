Measure blood glucose level and treat hypoglycaemia (Chapter 1) if necessary. Monitor vital signs and signs of dehydration every 15 to 30 minutes. Monitor urine output. Monitor for signs of fluid overload (see box below). If there is no circulatory impairment: ReSoMal PO or by NGT: 20 ml/kg over 1 hour If the child is alert, continue feeding including breastfeeding. Assess after 1 hour: If improvement: change to Plan B SAM, but keep the same target weight. If rehydration PO/NGT not tolerated (e. g. vomiting): Stop ReSoMal. Administer glucose 5%-Ringer lactate (G5%-RL) d IV infusion: 10 ml/kg/hour for 2 hours. Assess after 2 hours of IV fluids: If improvement and/or not vomiting, stop G5%-RL IV infusion and change to Plan B SAM. If no improvement or still vomiting, continue G5%-RL IV infusion: 10 ml/kg/hour for 2 hours. If deterioration with circulatory impairment: see below. If there is circulatory impairment: Administer ceftriaxone IV, one dose of 80 mg/kg. Subsequent antibiotic treatment depends on assessment of underlying cause. Administer G5%-RL IV infusion: 10 ml/kg/hour for 2 hours. Stop ReSoMal if the child was taking it. Assess after 1 hour of IV fluids: If improvement and no vomiting: stop IV fluid and change to Plan B SAM, but keep the same target weight. If no improvement: Continue G5%-RL IV infusion: 10 ml/kg/hour. Prepare for blood transfusion. Assess after 2 hours of IV fluids: If improvement: change to Plan B SAM, but keep the same target weight. If no improvement or deterioration: Check Hb as baseline and administer blood transfusion using a separate IV line. See Anaemia (Chapter 1) for volume to be transfused and patient monitoring during and after transfusion. While transfusing, continue G5%-RL IV infusion 10 ml/kg/hour for another 2 hours. Signs of fluid overload include: RR â‰¥ 10 breaths/minute compared to
