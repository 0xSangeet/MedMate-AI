Nutritional treatment is based on the use of specialised nutritious foods enriched with vitamins and minerals: F-75 and F-100 therapeutic milks, and ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). Nutritional treatment is organised into phases: Phase 1 (inpatient) intends to restore metabolic functions and treat or stabilize medical complications. Children receive F-75 therapeutic milk. This phase may last 1 to 7 days, after which children usually enter transition phase. Children with medical complications generally begin with phase 1. Transition phase (inpatient) intends to ensure tolerance of increased food intake and continued improvement of clinical condition. Children receive F-100 therapeutic milk and/or RUTF. This phase usually lasts 1 to 3 days, after which children enter phase 2. Phase 2 (outpatient or inpatient) intends to promote rapid weight gain and catch-up growth. Children receive RUTF. This phase usually lasts 1 to 3 days when inpatient, after which children are discharged for outpatient care. Children without medical complications enter directly into this phase as outpatients. The outpatient component usually lasts several weeks. Breastfeeding should be continued in breastfed children. Drinking water should be given in addition to meals, especially if the ambient temperature is high, or the child has a fever or is receiving RUTF.
