Severe dehydration Treat shock if present (see Shock, Chapter 1). If able to drink, administer oral rehydration solution (ORS) PO whilst obtaining IV access. according to WHO Treatment Plan C, monitoring infusion rate closely: Insert peripheral IV line using large caliber catheter (22-24G in children or 18G in adults) or intraosseous needle. Administer Ringer lactate (RL) a WHO Treatment Plan C [1] [2] Age First, give 30 ml/kg over (c) : Then, give 70 ml/kg over: Children < 1 year 1 hour 5 hours Children ≥ 1 year and adults 30 minutes 2 ½ hours (c) Repeat once if radial pulse remains weak or absent after first bolus. In case of suspected severe anaemia, measure haemoglobin and treat accordingly (see Anaemia, Chapter 1). b As soon as the patient is able to drink safely (often within 2 hours), provide ORS as the patient tolerates. ORS contains glucose and electrolytes which prevent development of complications. Monitor ongoing losses closely. Assess clinical condition and degree of dehydration at regular intervals to ensure continuation of appropriate treatment. If over the course of treatment the patient: remains or becomes lethargic: measure blood glucose level and/or treat hypoglycaemia (see Hypoglycaemia, Chapter 1). develops muscle cramps/weakness and abdominal distention: treat for moderate hypokalaemia with 7.5% potassium chloride syrup (1 mmol of K+/ml) PO for 2 days: Children under 45 kg: 2 mmol/kg (2 ml/kg) daily (according to weight, the daily dose is divided into 2 or 3 doses) Children 45 kg and over and adults: 30 mmol (30 ml) 3 times daily This treatment should only be given as an inpatient c . develops peri-orbital or peripheral oedema: reduce the infusion rate to a minimum, auscultate the lungs, re- evaluate the stage of dehydration and the necessity of continuing IV rehydration. If IV rehydration is still
