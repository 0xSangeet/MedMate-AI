4 hours if necessary 48 hours. Notes on the use of morphine and derivatives: Morphine is an effective treatment for many types of severe pain. Its analgesic effect is dosedependent. Its adverse effects have often been exaggerated and should not be an obstacle to its use. The most serious adverse effect of morphine is respiratory depression, which may be fatal. This adverse effect results from overdose. It is, therefore, important to increase doses gradually. Respiratory depression is preceded by drowsiness, which is a warning to monitor respiratory rate (RR). The RR should remain equal to or greater than the thresholds indicated below: Children 1 to 12 months RR ≥ 25 respirations/minute Children 1 to 2 years RR ≥ 20 respirations/minute Children 2 to 5 years RR ≥ 15 respirations/minute Children > 5 years and adults RR ≥ 10 respirations/minute Respiratory depression must be identified and treated quickly: verbal and physical stimulation of the patient; administration of oxygen; respiratory support (bag and mask) if necessary. If no improvement, administer naloxone (antagonist of morphine) in bolus to be repeated every minute until RR normalises and the excessive drowsiness resolves: 5 micrograms/kg in children and 1 to 3 micrograms/kg in adults. Morphine and codeine always cause constipation. A laxative should be prescribed if the opioid treatment continues more than 48 hours. Lactulose PO is the drug of choice: children < 1 year: 5 ml daily; children 1-6 years: 5 to 10 ml daily; children 7-14 years: 10 to 15 ml daily; adults: 15 to 45 ml daily. Page 42 / 409
