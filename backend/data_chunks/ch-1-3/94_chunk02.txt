(Chapter 3). Amoebiasis: antiparasitic treatment only if motile Entamoeba histolytica amoebae are found in stools or if a correct shigellosis treatment has been ineffective (see Amoebiasis, Chapter 3). Prevention Breastfeeding reduces infant morbidity and mortality from diarrhoea and the severity of diarrhoea episodes. When the child is weaned preparation and storage of food are associated with the risk of contamination by faecal micro-organisms: discourage bottle-feeding; food must be cooked well; milk or porridge must never be stored at room temperature. Access to sufficient amounts of clean water and personal hygiene (washing hands with soap and water before food preparation and before eating, after defecation etc.) are effective methods of reducing the spread of diarrhoea. In countries with a high rotavirus diarrhoea fatality rate, the WHO recommends routine rotavirus vaccination in children between 6 weeks and 24 months of age [1] . References 1.
