Staphylococcal pneumonia Pneumonia due to Staphylococcus aureus affecting young children, often those in a poor general condition (malnutrition, skin lesions, etc.). Staphylococcal pneumonia is a classic complication of measles. Clinical features General signs: change in overall condition, pallor, high fever or hypothermia, frequently signs of shock; presence of skin lesions (point of bacterial entry), however, skin lesions may be absent. Gastrointestinal signs: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, painful abdominal distention. Respiratory signs: dry cough, tachypnoea, signs of distress (nasal flaring, chest indrawing). Pulmonary auscultation is often normal; sometimes dullness indicating pleural effusion. Paraclinical investigations Chest x-ray (if available): may show multilobar consolidation, cavitation, pneumatoceles, spontaneous pneumothorax. Treatment Treatment is urgent as patients deteriorate quickly: hospitalise. Antibiotic treatment: if staphylococcal aetiology cannot be confirmed or while waiting for confirmation, a broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is recommended: ceftriaxone IM or slow IV a (at least 3 minutes): 50 mg/kg once daily + cloxacillin IV infusion (60 minutes) b Neonates 0 to 7 days (< 2 kg): 50 mg/kg every 12 hours Neonates 0 to 7 days (≥ 2 kg): 50 mg/kg every 8 hours Neonates 8 days to < 1 month (< 2 kg): 50 mg/kg every 8 hours Neonates 8 days to < 1 month (≥ 2 kg): 50 mg/kg every 6 hours Children 1 month and over: 25 to 50 mg/kg every 6 hours (max. 8 g daily) After clinical improvement c , 3 days with no fever, and drain removal if any, switch to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid PO to complete 10 to 14 days. Use formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1 exclusively. The dose is expressed in amoxicillin: 50 mg/kg 2 times daily In the event of large empyema: same treatment but switch to the oral route after 7 days with no fever and treat for 3 weeks. Clindamycin IV
