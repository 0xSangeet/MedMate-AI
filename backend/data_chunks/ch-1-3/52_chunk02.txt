immediately necessary. Outbreak surveillance measures A suspected case of diphtheria is defined as a person with: pharyngitis, rhinopharyngitis, tonsillitis and/or laryngitis AND an adherent pseudo-membrane of the pharynx, nose, tonsils and/or larynx [1] . Isolate and treat suspect cases without delay. Collect swab samples before starting antibiotic treatment. Submit case notification to the public health authorities within 24 hours [1] . Prevention Routine vaccination (EPI), for information: 3 doses of conjugate vaccine containing the higher potency (D) formulation of diphtheria toxoid as soon as possible as of 6 weeks of age and at 4 week intervals; D booster between 12 and 23 months, then between 4 and 7 years; booster with a vaccine containing a reduced dose (d) of diphtheria toxoid between 9 and 15 years [5] . Catch-up vaccination (individuals who have not received routine vaccination), for information: children 1 to 6 years: 3 doses of conjugate vaccine containing the higher potency (D) formulation of diphtheria toxoid at least 4 weeks apart; children 7 years and over and adults (including medical staff): 3 doses of conjugate vaccine containing a reduced dose (d) of diphtheria toxoid. Administer with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between first and second dose and an interval of at least 6 months between second and third dose (in the event of an outbreak this interval may be reduced to 4 weeks to achieve protection quicker). Administer 2 subsequent booster doses containing d at least 4 weeks apart [5] . Footnotes (a) This guide focuses on respiratory diphtheria and signs due to the toxin. It should be noted that cutaneous diphtheria is still a significant reservoir of C. diphtheriae. Page 73 / 409
