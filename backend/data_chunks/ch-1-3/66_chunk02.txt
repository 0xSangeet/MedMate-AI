other respiratory secretions [7] ) of a person with suspected pertussis within 3 weeks of onset of paroxysmal cough Asymptomatic exposed people at high risk of complications or who will come into contact with people at high risk [4] [8] : pregnant women in the third trimester (risk to neonate), infants under 1 year, people with immunodepression, moderate to severe asthma, and consider for people with other underlying respiratory conditions and adults â‰¥ 65 years. Isolation of asymptomatic contacts is not necessary. Symptomatic contacts should be treated as suspected pertussis. Assess whether the person is up-to-date with pertussis vaccination according to national protocol (see Prevention). Prevention Pertussis vaccination provides substantial immunity that wanes over time [1] . In all cases (suspected cases and contacts) who are not up-to-date with pertussis vaccination, begin or refer for vaccination. Routine vaccination with a 3-dose primary series of polyvalent vaccine containing pertussis antigen(s) from the age of 6 weeks or according to national protocol. A booster dose is recommended, preferably during the second year of life [1] . Based on local epidemiology, further booster doses may be required later in life to reinforce immunity and reduce the risk of developing pertussis. If the pertussis primary vaccination series has been interrupted, it should be completed rather than restarted from the beginning. In general, vaccinations are deferred for patients with moderate to severe illness, but the vaccine should be administered as soon as the patient's condition has improved. Vaccination will probably not prevent disease in a person who is already infected by B. pertussis. It is not a substitute for post-exposure prophylaxis [7] [9] . Page 87 / 409
