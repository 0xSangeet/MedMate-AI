Acute upper airway obstruction Acute upper airway obstruction can be caused by foreign body aspiration, viral or bacterial infections (croup, epiglottitis, tracheitis), anaphylaxis, burns or trauma. Initially stable and partial obstruction may worsen and develop into a life-threatening emergency, especially in young children. Clinical features Clinical signs of the severity of obstruction: Danger Obstruction Signs signs Complete Respiratory distress followed by cardiac arrest Imminent Severe respiratory distress with cyanosis or SpO < 90% 2 complete Agitation or lethargy Tachycardia, capillary refill time > 3 seconds Severe Stridor (abnormal high pitched sound on inspiration) at rest Yes Severe respiratory distress: Severe intercostal and subcostal retractions Nasal flaring Substernal retractions (inward movement of the breastbone during inspiration) Severe tachypnoea Moderate Stridor with agitation Moderate respiratory distress: Mild intercostal and subcostal retractions No Moderate tachypnoea Mild Cough, hoarse voice, no respiratory distress Management in all cases Examine children in the position in which they are the most comfortable. Evaluate the severity of the obstruction according to the table above. Monitor SpO , except in mild obstruction. 2 Administer oxygen continuously: to maintain the SpO between 94 and 98% if it is â‰¤ 90% a or if the patient has cyanosis or respiratory distress; 2 if pulse oxymeter is not available: at least 5 litres/minute or to relieve the hypoxia and improve respiration. Hospitalize (except if obstruction is mild), in intensive care if danger signs. Monitor mental status, heart and respiratory rate, SpO and severity of obstruction. 2 Maintain adequate hydration by mouth if possible, by IV if patient unable to drink. Page 62 / 409
