Dyspepsia Last updated: December 2020 Clinical features Epigastric pain or discomfort following meals, often accompanied by bloating, sensation of fullness and nausea. Dyspepsia is most commonly functional. The diagnosis of functional dyspepsia is based on clinical assessment after ruling out organic causes (Gastro-oesophageal reflux, Gastric and duodenal ulcers, drug-induced symptoms, gastric cancer). If possible, test for Helicobacter pylori. Treatment In adults: In case of patients who test positive for H. pylori, see Eradication of Helicobacter pylori [1] . Omeprazole PO (10 mg once daily) for 4 weeks may help even in H. pylori-negative patients [2] [3] . Note: consider and treat possible intestinal parasites (see Intestinal protozoan infections, Cestodes, Nematode infections, Chapter 6; Amoebiasis, Chapter 3). References 1.
