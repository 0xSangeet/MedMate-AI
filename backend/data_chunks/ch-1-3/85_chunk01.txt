Children: 40 mg/kg (max. 2 g) Adults: 2 g If symptoms improve: continue salbutamol (solution for nebuliser) every 1 to 4 hours (depending on symptoms) and oxygen as above. Assess symptoms at the end of each nebulisation. When possible, switch to salbutamol MDI and continue as for mild to moderate attack. If the attack is completely resolved, observe the patient for at least 4 hours. Continue the treatment with salbutamol (MDI) and prednisolone PO and reassess as for a mild to moderate attack. Notes: In pregnant women, treatment is the same as for adults. In mild or moderate asthma attacks, administering oxygen reduces the risk of foetal hypoxia. For all patients, irrespective of the severity of the asthma attack, look for underlying lung infection and treat accordingly. Footnotes (a) If a conventional spacer is not available, use a 500 ml plastic bottle: insert the mouthpiece of the inhaler into a hole made in the bottom of the bottle (the seal should be as tight as possible). The patient breathes from the mouth of the bottle in the same way as they would with a spacer. The use of a plastic cup instead of a spacer is not recommended (ineffective). (b) If pulse oxymetry is not available, administer oxygen continuously in case of moderate, severe or life-threatening attack. (c) If signs of life-threatening attack, transfer to intensive care unit as soon as possible. References 1. British guideline on the management of asthma.
