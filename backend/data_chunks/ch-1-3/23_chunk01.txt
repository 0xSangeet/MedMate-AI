Commonly used analgesics are often ineffective in treating this type of pain. Treatment of neuropathic pain is based on a combination of two centrally acting drugs: amitriptyline PO Adults: 25 mg once daily at bedtime (Week 1); 50 mg once daily at bedtime (Week 2); 75 mg once daily at bedtime (as of Week 3); max.150 mg daily. Reduce the dose by half in elderly patients. carbamazepine PO Adults: 200 mg once daily at bedtime (Week 1); 200 mg 2 times daily (Week 2); 200 mg 3 times daily (as of Week 3) Given its teratogenic risk, carbamazepine should only be used in women of childbearing age when covered by effective contraception (intrauterine device or injectable progestogen). It is not recommended in pregnant women. Mixed pain In mixed pain with a significant component of nociceptive pain, such as in cancer or AIDS, morphine is combined with antidepressants and antiepileptics. Chronic pain In contrast to acute pain, medical treatment alone is not always sufficient in controlling chronic pain. A multidisciplinary approach including medical treatment, physiotherapy, psychotherapy and nursing is often necessary to allow good pain relief and encourage patient selfmanagement. Co-analgesics The combination of certain drugs may be useful or even essential in the treatment of pain: antispasmodics, muscle relaxants, anxiolytics, corticosteroids, local anaesthesia, etc. Page 44 / 409
