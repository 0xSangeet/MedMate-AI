minutes or recurs within 5 minutes, start treatment for status epilepticus. Status epilepticus In case of status epilepticus, start antiseizure medication (ASM). ASMs may cause respiratory depression, bradycardia, and hypotension, especially in children and older patients. During and after ASM administration: have ventilation equipment (Ambu and mask) and solutions for fluid replacement ready for use, monitor RR, SpO , HR, and BP at least every 15 minutes until stable. 2 Never administer ASMs by rapid IV injection. Reduce the administration rate in the event of drop in RR, HR, or BP. Step 1 - First-line ASM treatment Administer one of the following benzodiazepines (BZD). The choice depends on the situation, i.e. if seizures occur in pre-hospital or hospital setting. In any case, do not administer more than 2 doses of BZD. Status epilepticus in pre-hospital setting Administer midazolam (5 mg/ml solution) by buccal or intranasal route or diazepam (5 mg/ml solution) by rectal route. For doses to be administered, see Table 1. If seizures do not stop 5 minutes after the first dose of BZD, readminister the same dose. If seizures do not stop after the second dose of BZD, refer urgently to hospital for treatment with second-line ASM(s). If seizures stop after 1 or 2 doses of BZD, refer to hospital for further management (aetiologic treatment and potential maintenance treatment). While awaiting transfer, monitor vital signs, administer oxygen if available to maintain SpO > 94%. If seizures stop, 2 see Postictal management. Status epilepticus in hospital setting Page 23 / 409
