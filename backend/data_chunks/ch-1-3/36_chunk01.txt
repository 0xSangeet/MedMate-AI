Management of complications Infections Respiratory, cutaneous and urinary infections are common. However, classic signs of infection, such as fever, may be absent [1] . Severe infection or sepsis should be suspected in children that are lethargic or apathetic or suffering from an acute complication such as hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, seizures, difficulty breathing, or shock. Immediately administer ampicillin IV 50 mg/kg every 8 hours + gentamicin IV 7.5 mg/kg once daily. Continue this treatment unless the source of infection is identified and different antibiotic treatment is required. If circulatory impairment or shock, immediately administer ceftriaxone IV, one dose of 80 mg/kg, then assess the source of infection to determine further antibiotic treatment. See also Shock, Chapter 1. Transfuse urgently as for severe anaemia (see below) if haemoglobin (Hb) is < 6 g/dl. In less severe infections, assess the source of infection (see Fever, Chapter 1) and treat accordingly. If fever is present and causes discomfort, undress the child. If insufficient, administer paracetamol PO in low dose: 10 mg/kg, up to 3 times maximum per 24 hours. Encourage oral fluids (including breast milk). If hypothermia is present, place the child skin-to-skin against the mother's body and cover with a warm blanket. Treat for infection as above. Check blood glucose level and treat for hypoglycaemia if necessary (see Hypoglycaemia, Chapter 1). In children with kwashiorkor, infection of cutaneous lesions is common and may progress to soft tissue or systemic infection. If cutaneous infection is present, stop amoxicillin and start amoxicillin/clavulanic acid PO. Use formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1. The dose is expressed in amoxicillin: 50 mg/kg 2 times daily for 7 days. Severe anaemia Children with Hb < 4 or < 6 with signs of decompensation (such as respiratory distress) or ongoing blood loss require transfusion within the first 24 hours.
